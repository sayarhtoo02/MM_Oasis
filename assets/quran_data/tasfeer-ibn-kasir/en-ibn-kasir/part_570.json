Verily, We have placed you as a successor on the earth; so judge you between men in truth <span class=\"gray\">(and justice)</span> and follow not your desire – for it will mislead you from the path of Allah.

They should rule according to the truth and justice revealed from Him, they should not turn away from it and be led astray from the path of Allah. Allah has issued a stern warning of a severe punishment to those who go astray from His path and forget the Day of Resurrection.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibrahim Abu Zur'ah, who read the Scripture, reported that Al-Walid bin 'Abd Al-Malik said to him: \"Does anyone have the right to question the Khalifah? You have read the first Scripture and the Qur'an, and you have understood them.\" He replied, \"May I speak, O Commander of the faithful?\" He said, \"Speak, for you are under the protection of Allah.\" I said, \"O Commander of the faithful, are you more dear to Allah, or Dawud, peace be upon him For Allah gave him both prophethood and rulership, then He warned him in His Book:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا دَاوُودُ إِنَّا جَعَلْنَاكَ خَلِيفَةً فِي الْأَرْضِ فَاحْكُمْ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ بِالْحَقِّ وَلَا تَتَّبِعِ الْهَوَىٰ فَيُضِلَّكَ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Dawud !

And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Guide to the Truth.</p>"

    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire <span>(27)</span>Shall We treat those who believe and do righteous good deeds as those who cause mischief on the earth?

Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَاءَ وَالْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَاطِلًا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve!)</span> meaning, those who do not think that the resurrection and the place of return will occur, but they think that there is nothing after this world.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَوَيْلٌ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنَ النَّارِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!)</span> means, woe to them on the Day when they will be resurrected, from the Fire that is prepared for them. Then Allah explains that because of His justice and wisdom, He does not treat the believers and the disbelievers equally. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ كَالْمُفْسِدِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الْمُتَّقِينَ كَالْفُجَّارِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Shall We treat those who believe and do righteous good deeds as those who do mischief on the earth? Or shall We treat Those who have Taqwa as the evildoers?)</span> meaning, 'We shall not do that.' They are not equal before Allah, and since this is the case, there must inevitably be another realm in which those who obey Allah will be rewarded and the wicked will be punished. This teaching indicates to those of a sound mind and upright nature that there must inevitably be a resurrection and recompense. We see evildoers and criminals are prospering and increasing in wealth, children and luxury, until they die in that state. We see oppressed believers dying of grief and distress, so by the wisdom of the All-Wise, All-Knowing, All-Just who does not do even a speck of dust's weight of injustice, there should be a time when the rights of the oppressed are restored with due justice. If this does not happen in this world, there must be another realm where recompense may be made and consolation may be found. The Qur'an teaches sound aims based on a rational way of thinking, so Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كِتَابٌ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِيَدَّبَّرُوا آيَاتِهِ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(This is)</span> a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Ayat, and that men of understanding may remember.)</span> meaning, those who are possessed of wisdom and reason.</p>"

Mujahid said, \"They were the kind of horses which stand on three legs and raise the fourth, and they were swift horses.\" This was also the view of several others among the Salaf. Abu Dawud recorded that 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ came back from the campaign of Tabuk or Khaybar, and there was a curtain covering her room. The wind came and lifted the curtain, revealing some toys belonging to 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her. The Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا هَذَا يَا عَائِشَةُ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(What is this, O 'A'ishah?)</span> She, may Allah be pleased with her, said, \"My toys.\" Among them he saw a horse with two wings made of cloth. He ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا هَذَا الَّذِي أَرَى وَسَطَهُنَّ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(What is this that I see in the midst of them?)</span> She, may Allah be pleased with her, said, \"A horse.\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا هَذَا الَّذِي عَلَيْهِ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And what is this on it?)</span> She, may Allah be pleased with her, said, \"Wings.\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَرَسٌ لَهُ جَنَاحَانِ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(A horse with two wings?)</span> She, may Allah be pleased with her, said, \"Did you not hear that Sulayman, peace be upon him, had a horse that had wings?\" She, may Allah be pleased with her, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ smiled so broadly that I could see his molars.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَقَالَ إِنِّي أَحْبَبْتُ حُبَّ الْخَيْرِ عَنْ ذِكْرِ رَبِّي حَتَّىٰ تَوَارَتْ بِالْحِجَابِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He said: \"I did love the good <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., horses)</span> instead of remembering my Lord\" till the time was over, and <span class=\"gray\">(the sun)</span> had hidden in the veil <span class=\"gray\">(of night)</span>)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">More than one of the Salaf and scholars of Tafsir mentioned that he was so busy looking at the horses that he missed the time of 'Asr prayer. He did not miss it deliberately, but because of forgetfulness, as happened to the Prophet ﷺ on the day of Khandaq, when he was too busy to pray 'Asr and he prayed it after the sun had set. This was recorded in the Two Sahihs with more than one chain of narration, including the report from Jabir, may Allah be pleased with him, who said, \"On the day of Khandaq, 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, came after the sun had set and started cursing the disbelievers of the Quraysh. He said, 'O Messenger of Allah, I could not pray 'Asr until the sun had almost set.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللهِ مَا صَلَّيْتُهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By Allah, I did not pray it either.)</span>\" He <span class=\"gray\">(Jabir)</span> said, \"So we got up and went to Buthan. Allah's Prophet ﷺ performed ablution for the prayer and we too performed ablution. He prayed 'Asr after the sun had set, then he prayed Maghrib after that.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رُدُّوهَا عَلَيَّ ۖ فَطَفِقَ مَسْحًا بِالسُّوقِ وَالْأَعْنَاقِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then he said: \"Bring them <span class=\"gray\">(horses)</span> back to me.\" Then he began to pass his hand over their legs and their necks.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"He said, 'No, by Allah, you will not keep me from worshipping my Lord again,' then he ordered that they should be slaughtered.\" This was also the view of Qatadah. As-Suddi said, \"Their necks and hamstrings were struck with swords.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"He began patting the horses' heads and legs out of love for them.\" This is the view that was favored by Ibn Jarir. He said, \"Because he would not punish an animal by cutting its hamstrings or destroy his own wealth for no other reason than that he had been distracted from his prayer by looking at it, and it was not the animals' fault. \"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This view which Ibn Jarir thought more correct is subject to further review, because such action may have been permissible according to their law, especially since he got angry for the sake of Allah for being distracted by these horses until the time for prayer had lapsed. Then, since he dispensed with them for the sake of Allah, Allah compensated him with something better, the wind which blew gently by his order wherever he willed. Its morning lasted a month's <span class=\"gray\">(journey)</span>, and its afternoon lasted a month's <span class=\"gray\">(journey)</span>. This was faster and better than horses.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Qatadah and Abu Ad-Dahma', who traveled a lot to the Ka'bah, said, \"We met a man from among the bedouins who said to us: 'The Messenger of Allah ﷺ took my hand and started teaching me some of that which Allah had taught him. He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّكَ لَا تَدَعُ شَيْئًا اتِّقَاءَ اللهِ تَعَالَى إِلَّا أَعْطَاكَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ خَيْرًا مِنْهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(You do not give up anything for the sake of Allah, but Allah will give you something better than it.)</span>'\"</p>"
