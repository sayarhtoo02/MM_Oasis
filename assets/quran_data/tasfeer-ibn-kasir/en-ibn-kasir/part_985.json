This has been said by Ibn 'Abbas. It has been called this because it will overcome every matter. It will be frightful and horrifying. As Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالسَّاعَةُ أَدْهَىٰ وَأَمَرُّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(54:46)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَتَذَكَّرُ الْإِنسَانُ مَا سَعَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Day when man shall remember what he strove for.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, at that time the Son of Adam will reflect upon all of his deeds, both the good and the evil. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَذَكَّرُ الْإِنسَانُ وَأَنَّىٰ لَهُ الذِّكْرَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance avail him?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(89:23)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَبُرِّزَتِ الْجَحِيمُ لِمَن يَرَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Hell shall be made apparent for whoever sees.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, it will become apparent for the onlookers, so the people will see it with their own eyes.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَمَّا مَن طَغَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then for him who transgressed)</span> meaning, who rebels and behaves arrogantly.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَآثَرَ الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And preferred the life of this world,)</span> meaning, he gives it precedence over the matters of his religion and his Hereafter.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِنَّ الْجَحِيمَ هِيَ الْمَأْوَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily his abode will be the Hell;)</span> meaning, his final destination will be Hell, his food will be from the tree of Zaqqum, and his drink will be from Hamim.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ وَنَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But as for him who feared standing before his Lord and forbade himself from desire.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, he fears the standing before Allah, he fears Allah's judgement of him, he prevents his soul from following its desires, and he compels it to obey its Master.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ هِيَ الْمَأْوَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily Paradise will be his abode.)</span> meaning, his final abode, his destination, and his place of return will be the spacious Paradise. Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَاهَا - فِيمَ أَنتَ مِن ذِكْرَاهَا - إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ مُنتَهَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They ask you about the Hour – when will be its appointed time? What do you have to mention of it. To your Lord it is limited.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, its knowledge is not with you, nor with any creature. Rather the knowledge of it is with Allah. He is the One Who knows the exact time of its occurrence.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثَقُلَتْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ لَا تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلَّا بَغْتَةً ۗ يَسْأَلُونَكَ كَأَنَّكَ حَفِيٌّ عَنْهَا ۖ قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِندَ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden. They ask you as if you have a good knowledge of it. Say: \"The knowledge thereof is with Allah.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(7:187)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah says here,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ مُنتَهَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(To your Lord it is limited.)</span> Thus, when Jibril asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the time of the last Hour he said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا الْمَسْؤُولُ عَنْهَا بِأَعْلَمَ مِنَ السَّائِلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The one questioned about it knows no more than the questioner.)</span></p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّمَا أَنتَ مُنذِرُ مَن يَخْشَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(You are only a warner for those who fear it,)</span> meaning, 'I sent you to warn mankind and caution them to beware of the torment and punishment of Allah. So whoever fears Allah, fears standing before Him, and His threat, then he will follow you, and thus be successful and victorious. However, whoever denies you and opposes you, then he will only suffer loss and failure.' Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُوا إِلَّا عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Day they see it <span class=\"gray\">(it will be)</span> as if they had not tarried <span class=\"gray\">(in this world)</span> except an <span class=\"gray\">('Ashiyyah)</span> afternoon or its <span class=\"gray\">(Duha)</span> morning.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, when they stand up from their graves to go to the place of Gathering, they will feel that the period of the worldy life was short, it will seem to them that it was only the afternoon of one day. Juwaybir reported from Ad-Dahhak from Ibn 'Abbas:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُوا إِلَّا عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Day they see it <span class=\"gray\">(it will be)</span> as if they had not tarried <span class=\"gray\">(in this world)</span> except an <span class=\"gray\">('Ashiyyah)</span> afternoon or its <span class=\"gray\">(Duha)</span> morning.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"As for 'Ashiyyah, it is the time between noon until the setting of the sun.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">أَوْ ضُحَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or its <span class=\"gray\">(Duha)</span> morning)</span> what is between sunrise and midday <span class=\"gray\">(noon)</span>.\" Qatadah said, \"This refers to the time period of the worldly life in the eyes of the people when they see the Hereafter.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat An-Nazi'at. And to Allah belongs all praise and thanks.</p>"
