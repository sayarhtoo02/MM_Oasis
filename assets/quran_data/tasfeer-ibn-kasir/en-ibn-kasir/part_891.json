So have Taqwa of Allah, O men of understanding, those who believe! Allah has indeed sent down to you a Reminder <span>(10)</span>A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations, that He may take out those who believe and do righteous good deeds, from the darkness to the light. And whosoever believes in Allah and performs righteous deeds, He will admit him into Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. Allah has indeed granted for him an excellent provision <span>(11)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Punishment for defying Allah's Commandments</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah the Exalted threatens those who defy His commands, deny His Messengers and contradict His legislation, by informing them of the end that earlier nations met who did the same,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَأَيِّنْ مِنْ قَرْيَةٍ عَتَتْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهَا وَرُسُلِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And many a town revolted against the command of its Lord and His Messengers;)</span> meaning, they rebelled, rejected and arrogantly refused to obey Allah and they would not follow His Messengers,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\"> فَحَاسَبْنَاهَا حِسَابًا شَدِيدًا وَعَذَّبْنَاهَا عَذَابًا نُكْرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and We called it to a severe account, and We shall punish it with a horrible torment.)</span> meaning, horrendous and terrifying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَذَاقَتْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهَا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So it tasted the evil result of its affair,)</span> meaning, they tasted the evil consequences of defiance and they regretted their actions when regret does not avail,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَانَ عَاقِبَةُ أَمْرِهَا خُسْرًا - أَعَدَّ اللَّهُ لَهُمْ عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and the consequence of its affair was loss. And Allah has prepared for them a severe torment.)</span> means, in the Hereafter, added to the torment that was sent down on them in this life. Allah the Exalted said, after mentioning what happened to the disbelieving nations,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ يَا أُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So have Taqwa of Allah, O men of understanding,)</span> meaning, 'O you who have sound understanding, do not be like them because if you do, you will suffer what they suffered, O people of comprehension,'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(who believe)</span> meaning, in Allah and His Messengers,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَدْ أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكُمْ ذِكْرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah has indeed sent down to you a Reminder.)</span> meaning, this Qur'an. Allah also said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr and surely, We will preserve it.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(15:9)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Qualities of the Messenger <span class=\"gray\">(ﷺ)</span></p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَسُولًا يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِ اللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَاتٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Some said that the Messenger is the subject of what is being sent <span class=\"gray\">[as a reminder]</span> because the Messenger is the one that conveys the Dhikr. Ibn Jarir said that what is correct is that the Messenger explains the Dhikr. This is why Allah the Exalted said here,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَسُولًا يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِ اللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَاتٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations,)</span> meaning, plain and apparent. The statement of Allah;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> لِيُخْرِجَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ مِنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that He may take out those who believe and do righteous good deeds, from the darkness to the light.)</span> Allah's is like saying;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كِتَابٌ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(A Book which We have revealed unto you in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness)</span><span class=\"gray\">(14:1)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا يُخْرِجُهُمْ مِنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah is the Guardian of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:257)</span> meaning, out of the darkness of disbelief and ignorance into the light of faith and knowledge. Allah the Exalted called the revelation that He has sent down, light, on account of the guidance that it brings. Allah also called it Ruh, in that, it brings life to the hearts,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ رُوحًا مِنْ أَمْرِنَا ۚ مَا كُنْتَ تَدْرِي مَا الْكِتَابُ وَلَا الْإِيمَانُ وَلَٰكِنْ جَعَلْنَاهُ نُورًا نَهْدِي بِهِ مَنْ نَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ۚ وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِي إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And thus We have sent to you Ruh of our command. You knew not what is the book, nor what is faith? But We have made it a light wherewith we guide whosoever of Our servants We will. And verily, you are indeed guiding to the straight path.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(42:52)</span> Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ يُؤْمِنْ بِاللَّهِ وَيَعْمَلْ صَالِحًا يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ۖ قَدْ أَحْسَنَ اللَّهُ لَهُ رِزْقًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whosoever believes in Allah and performs righteous good deeds, He will admit him into Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. Allah has indeed granted for him an excellent provision.)</span> was explained several times before, and therefore, we do not need to repeat its explanation here. All the thanks and praises are due to Allah.</p>"
