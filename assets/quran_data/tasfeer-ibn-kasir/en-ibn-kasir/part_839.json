Remember My favor to you and to your mother when I supported you with Ruh - il-Qudus <span class=\"gray\">[Jibril]</span> so that you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and when I taught you the Book, the Hikmah, the Tawrah and the Injil; and when you made out of the clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My permission, and you breathed into it, and it became a bird by My permission, and you healed those born blind, and the lepers by My permission, and when you brought forth the dead by My permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from you since you came unto them with clear proofs, and the disbelievers among them said: 'This is nothing but evident magic.' <span>(110)</span>\"And when I Awhaytu <span class=\"gray\">[put in the hearts of]</span> Al-Hawariyyin to believe in Me and My Messenger, they said: 'We believe. And bear witness that we are Muslims.' <span>(111)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Reminding 'Isa of the Favors that Allah Granted him</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah mentions how He blessed His servant and Messenger, 'Isa, son of Maryam, and the miracles and extraordinary acts He granted him. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اذْكُرْ نِعْمَتِي عَلَيْكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Remember My favor to you)</span> when I created you from your mother, without male intervention, and made you a sign and clear proof of My perfect power over all things.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَعَلَىٰ وَالِدَتِكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And to your mother)</span> when I made you testify to her chastity and you thus absolved her from the sin that the unjust, ignorant liars accused her of,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذْ أَيَّدتُّكَ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(when I supported you with Ruh-il-Qudus)</span> the angel Jibril, and made you a Prophet, calling to Allah in the cradle and manhood. I made you speak in the cradle, and you testified that your mother was free from any immoral behavior, and you proclaimed that you worship Me. You also conveyed the news of My Message and invited them to worship Me.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> تُكَلِّمُ النَّاسَ فِي الْمَهْدِ وَكَهْلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so that you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity;)</span> Meaning you called the people to Allah in childhood and in maturity. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And the word Tukallim means invited, because his speaking to people while a child is nothing strange by itself. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذْ عَلَّمْتُكَ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when I taught you the Book and the Hikmah,)</span> the power of writing and understanding,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالتَّوْرَاةَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and the Tawrah,)</span> which was revealed to Musa, son of 'Imran, who spoke to Allah directly. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذْ تَخْلُقُ مِنَ الطِّينِ كَهَيْئَةِ الطَّيْرِ بِإِذْنِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and when you made out of the clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My permission,)</span> means: 'you shaped it in the figure of a bird by My permission, and it became a bird with My permission, after you blew into it'. Then, it became a flying bird with a soul by Allah's permission. Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتُبْرِئُ الْأَكْمَهَ وَالْأَبْرَصَ بِإِذْنِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and you healed those born blind, and the lepers by My permission,)</span> This was explained before in Surah Āl-'Imrān <span class=\"gray\">(chapter 3)</span> and we do not need to repeat it here. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذْ تُخْرِجُ الْمَوْتَىٰ بِإِذْنِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when you brought forth the dead by My permission,)</span> meaning, you called them and they rose from their graves by Allah's leave, power, lntent and will. Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذْ كَفَفْتُ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَنكَ إِذْ جِئْتَهُم بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ فَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْهُمْ إِنْ هَٰذَا إِلَّا سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and when I restrained the Children of Israel from you since you came unto them with clear proofs, and the disbelievers among them said: \"This is nothing but evident magic.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Meaning: 'remember My favor, when I stopped the Children of Israel from harming you, when you brought them the clear proofs and evidence, testifying to your prophethood and Message from Me to them. They rejected you and accused you of being a magician and tried to kill you by crucifixion, but I saved you, raised you to Me, purified you from their vulgarity and protected you from their harm.'</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The wording of this Ayah indicates that 'Isa will be reminded of these favors on the Day of Resurrection. Allah used the past tense in these Ayat indicating that it is a forgone matter that will certainly occur. This Ayah also contains some of the secrets of the Unseen that Allah revealed to His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذْ أَوْحَيْتُ إِلَى الْحَوَارِيِّينَ أَنْ آمِنُوا بِي وَبِرَسُولِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when I <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span> Awhaytu Al-Hawariyyin to believe in Me and My Messenger.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is also a reminder of Allah's favor on 'Isa, by making discples and companions for him. It is also said that Awhaytu in the Ayah means, 'inspired', just as in another Ayah, Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَىٰ أُمِّ مُوسَىٰ أَنْ أَرْضِعِيهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We inspired the mother of Musa <span class=\"gray\">(saying)</span>: Suckle him...)</span><span class=\"gray\">[28:7]</span> Allah said in other Ayat,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَوْحَىٰ رَبُّكَ إِلَى النَّحْلِ أَنِ اتَّخِذِي مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا وَمِنَ الشَّجَرِ وَمِمَّا يَعْرِشُونَ - ثُمَّ كُلِي مِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَاتِ فَاسْلُكِي سُبُلَ رَبِّكِ ذُلُلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And your Lord Awha <span class=\"gray\">(inspired)</span> the bee, saying: \"Take habitations in the mountains and in the trees and in what they erect. Then, eat of all fruits, and follow the ways of your Lord made easy <span class=\"gray\">(for you)</span>.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[16:68-69]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Hasan Al-Basri commented about the Hawariyyun, \"Allah inspired them\", while As-Suddi said, \"He put in their hearts,\" and the Hawariyyun said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">آمَنَّا وَاشْهَدْ بِأَنَّنَا مُسْلِمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We believe. And bear witness that we are Muslims.)</span></p>"
