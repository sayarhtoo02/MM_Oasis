I have killed a man among them,)</span> meaning, that Coptic,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَخَافُ أَنْ يَقْتُلُونِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and I fear that they will kill me.)</span> i.e., 'when they see me.'</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَأَخِي هَارُونُ هُوَ أَفْصَحُ مِنِّي لِسَانًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And my brother Harun – he is more eloquent in speech than me,)</span> Musa, peace be upon him, had a speech defect, because when he had been given the choice between a date and a pearl, he mistakenly picked up a coal and placed it on his tongue, so he found it difficult to speak clearly. Musa said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاحْلُلْ عُقْدَةً مِنْ لِسَانِي - يَفْقَهُوا قَوْلِي - وَاجْعَلْ لِي وَزِيرًا مِنْ أَهْلِي - هَارُونَ أَخِي - اشْدُدْ بِهِ أَزْرِي - وَأَشْرِكْهُ فِي أَمْرِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"And loose the knot <span class=\"gray\">(the defect)</span> from my tongue. That they understand my speech. And appoint for me a helper from my family, Harun, my brother. Increase my strength with him, And let him share my task.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(20:27-32)</span> meaning, 'give me someone to keep me company in this immense task of prophethood and conveying the Message to this arrogant, tyrannical and stubborn king.' Hence Musa said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَخِي هَارُونُ هُوَ أَفْصَحُ مِنِّي لِسَانًا فَأَرْسِلْهُ مَعِيَ رِدْءًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And my brother Harun – he is more eloquent in speech than me: so send him with me as a helper)</span> meaning, as a support to give strength to my cause and confirm what I say and convey from Allah, because the word of two carries more weight in people's minds than the word of one. So he said:</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">إِنِّي أَخَافُ أَنْ يُكَذِّبُونِ</p><p lang=\"mg\" class=\"mg \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, I fear that they will deny me.)</span> Muhammad bin Ishaq said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رِدْءًا يُصَدِّقُنِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(as a helper to confirm me.)</span> means, 'to explain to them what I say, for he can understand me where they may not.' When Musa asked for this, Allah said to him:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We will strengthen your arm through your brother,)</span> meaning, 'We will add strength to your cause and give you help through your brother, who you have asked to be made a Prophet alongside you.' This is like the Ayat;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يَا مُوسَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(You are granted your request, O Musa!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(20:36)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ مِنْ رَحْمَتِنَا أَخَاهُ هَارُونَ نَبِيًّا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We granted him his brother Harun, <span class=\"gray\">(also)</span> a Prophet, out of Our mercy)</span><span class=\"gray\">(19:53)</span>. One of the Salaf said, \"There is no one who has ever done a greater favor to his brother than Musa did for Harun, may peace be upon them both, for he interceded for him until Allah made him a Prophet and Messenger with him to Fir'awn and his chiefs. Allah said concerning Musa:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَانَ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ وَجِيهًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(he was honorable before Allah)</span><span class=\"gray\">(33:69)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَانًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and <span class=\"gray\">(We will)</span> give you both power)</span> means, overwhelming evidence.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا ۚ بِآيَاتِنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our Ayat;)</span> means, 'they will have no way or means of harming you because you are conveying the signs of Allah.' This is like the Ayat:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِنْ رَبِّكَ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Messenger! Proclaim <span class=\"gray\">(the Message)</span> which has been sent down to you from your Lord.)</span> until His saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ يَعْصِمُكَ مِنَ النَّاسِ ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah will protect you from mankind)</span><span class=\"gray\">(5:67)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ يُبَلِّغُونَ رِسَالَاتِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who convey the Message of Allah)</span> until His saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ حَسِيبًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And sufficient is Allah as a Reckoner)</span><span class=\"gray\">(33:39)</span>. And sufficient is Allah as a Helper and Supporter.

Fir'awn and his chiefs saw that with their own eyes and realized that it was certainly from Allah, but because of their disbelief and sin they resorted to stubbornness and false arguments. This was because they were too evil and arrogant to follow the truth.
