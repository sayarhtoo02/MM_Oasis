He ordained the prayer, which affirms the worship of Allah alone, without partners, and to spend from the provisions that He has granted them, by paying the due Zakah, spending on relatives and being kind to all others. Establishing the prayer requires performing it on time, perfectly, preserving its act of bowing having humility during it, and preserving its prostrations. Allah has ordained spending from what He granted, in secret and public, so that the people save themselves,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(before the coming of a Day)</span>, the Day of Resurrection,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خِلَالٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(on which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.)</span> on which no ransom will be accepted from anyone, if he seeks to buy himself.

A man chooses his friends and the reasons behind befriending them; if it was for Allah's sake, their friendship should be maintained, but if it was for other than Allah, their friendship is bound to be cutoff.\" I say that the meaning of this, is that Allah the Exalted is declaring that on that Day, no mutual bargaining or ransom will avail anyone, even if he ransoms himself with the earth's fill of gold if he could find that amount! No friendship or intercession shall avail one if he meets Allah while a disbeliever. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاتَّقُوا يَوْمًا لَّا تَجْزِي نَفْسٌ عَن نَّفْسٍ شَيْئًا وَلَا يُقْبَلُ مِنْهَا عَدْلٌ وَلَا تَنفَعُهَا شَفَاعَةٌ وَلَا هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And fear the Day when no person shall avail another, nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be of use to him, nor shall they be helped.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:123]</span> and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنفِقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لَّا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خُلَّةٌ وَلَا شَفَاعَةٌ ۗ وَالْكَافِرُونَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you believe! Spend of that with which We have provided for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession.
