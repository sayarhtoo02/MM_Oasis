    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Whoever hopes in meeting with Allah, then Allah's term is surely coming, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower <span>(5)</span>And whosoever strives, he strives only for himself. Verily, Allah stands not in need of any of the creatures <span>(6)</span>Those who believe, and do righteous good deeds, surely, We shall expiate from them their evil deeds and We shall indeed reward them according to the best of that which they used to do <span>(7)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Allah will fulfill the Hopes of the Righteous</h2></div><p lang=\"jv\" class=\"jv \">Allah's saying;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَاءَ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever hopes in meeting with Allah,)</span> means, in the Hereafter, and does righteous deeds, and hopes for a great reward with Allah, then Allah will fulfill his hopes and reward him for his deeds in full. This will undoubtedly come to pass, for He is the One Who hears all supplications, He knows and understands the needs of all created beings. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَاءَ اللَّهِ فَإِنَّ أَجَلَ اللَّهِ لَآتٍ ۚ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever hopes in meeting with Allah, then Allah's term is surely coming, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ جَاهَدَ فَإِنَّمَا يُجَاهِدُ لِنَفْسِهِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whosoever strives, he strives only for himself.)</span> This is like the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحًا فَلِنَفْسِهِ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whosoever does righteous good deed, it is for himself)</span><span class=\"gray\">(41:46)</span>. Whoever does a righteous deed, the benefit of that deed will come back to him, for Allah has no need of the deeds of His servants, and even if all of them were to be as pious as the most pious man among them, that would not add to His dominion in the slightest. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ جَاهَدَ فَإِنَّمَا يُجَاهِدُ لِنَفْسِهِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِيٌّ عَنِ الْعَالَمِينَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whosoever strives, he strives only for himself. Verily, Allah stands not in need of any of the creatures.)</span> Then Allah tells us that even though He has no need of His creatures, He is kind and generous to them. He will still give to those who believe and do righteous deeds the best of rewards, which is that He will expiate for them their bad deeds, and will reward them according to the best deeds that they did. He will accept the fewest good deeds and in return for one good deed will give anything between ten rewards and seven hundred, but for every bad deed, He will give only one evil merit, or even that He may overlook and forgive. This is like the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ ۖ وَإِنْ تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَاعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِنْ لَدُنْهُ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely, Allah wrongs not even the weight of a speck of dust, but if there is any good, He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:40)</span>. And He says here:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ لَنُكَفِّرَنَّ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَحْسَنَ الَّذِي كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who believe, and do righteous good deeds, surely, We shall expiate from them their evil deeds and We shall indeed reward them according to the best of that which they used to do.)</span></p>"

Allah says:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">قُلْ</p><p lang=\"mg\" class=\"mg \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say)</span> – 'O Muhammad' –</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّمَا الْآيَاتُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The signs are only with Allah)</span> meaning, 'the matter rests with Allah, and if He knew that you would be guided, He would respond to your request, because it is very easy for Him to do that. Yet He knows that you are merely being stubborn and putting me to the test, so He will not respond to you.' This is like the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا مَنَعَنَا أَنْ نُرْسِلَ بِالْآيَاتِ إِلَّا أَنْ كَذَّبَ بِهَا الْأَوَّلُونَ ۚ وَآتَيْنَا ثَمُودَ النَّاقَةَ مُبْصِرَةً فَظَلَمُوا بِهَا ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And nothing stops Us from sending the Ayat but that the people of old denied them. And We sent the she-camel to Thamud as a clear sign, but they did her wrong)</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:59)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّمَا أَنَا نَذِيرٌ مُبِينٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and I am only a plain warner)</span> means, 'I have been sent to you only as a warner to bring a clear warning; all I have to do is convey the Message of Allah to you. '</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ يَهْدِ اللَّهُ فَهُوَ الْمُهْتَدِ ۖ وَمَنْ يُضْلِلْ فَلَنْ تَجِدَ لَهُ وَلِيًّا مُرْشِدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He whom Allah guides, he is the rightly-guided; but he whom He sends astray, for him you will find no guide to lead him.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(18:17)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِي مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Not upon you is their guidance, but Allah guides whom He wills)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:272)</span>. Then Allah shows us how ignorant and foolish they were when they demanded a sign to prove to them that what Muhammad ﷺ had brought to them was true. He brought them a great Book which falsehood cannot reach, neither from before it or behind it, it was greater than all other miracles, for the most eloquent of men could not match it or produce ten Surahs, or even one Surah like it.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِهِمْ أَنَّا أَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Is it not sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book which is recited to them?)</span> means, 'is it not sufficient as a sign for them that We have sent down to you this great Book which tells them about what happened before their time, what will happen after they are gone, and passes judgement between them. Even though you are an unlettered man who can neither read nor write, and you have not mixed with any of the People of the Book. Yet you brought them news of what was said in the first Scriptures showing what is right in the matters that they dispute over, and bringing clear and obvious truth.' As Allah says:</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">أَوَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُمْ آيَةً أَنْ يَعْلَمَهُ عُلَمَاءُ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Is it not a sign to them that the learned scholars of the Children of Israel knew it <span class=\"gray\">(to be true)</span>?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(26:197)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالُوا لَوْلَا يَأْتِينَا بِآيَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّهِ ۚ أَوَلَمْ تَأْتِهِمْ بَيِّنَةُ مَا فِي الصُّحُفِ الْأُولَىٰ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They say: \"Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord?\" Has there not come to them the proof of that which is in the former Scriptures?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(20:133)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا مِنَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ مِنْ نَبِيٍّ إِلَّا قَدْ أُعْطِيَ مِنَ الْآيَاتِ مَا مِثْلُهُ آمَنَ عَلَيْهِ الْبَشَرُ، وَإِنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُهُ وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ، فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is no Prophet who was not given some miracles that would make the people believe in him. What I have been given is revelation which Allah reveals to me, and I hope that I will have the greatest number of followers on the Day of Resurrection.)</span>\" It was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. </p><p lang=\"so\" class=\"so \">Indeed Allah has said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَرَحْمَةً وَذِكْرَىٰ لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, herein is mercy and a reminder for a people who believe.)</span> In this Qur'an there is mercy, that is, explanation of the truth and removal of falsehood, and a reminder to the believers of the punishment that is to come to the disbelievers and sinners. Then Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ كَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكُمْ شَهِيدًا ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"Sufficient is Allah for a witness between me and you...\")</span> 'He knows best the words of denial that you utter, and he knows what I am telling you about Him and that He has sent me. If I were telling lies about Him, He would have executed His vengeance upon me,' as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ تَقَوَّلَ عَلَيْنَا بَعْضَ الْأَقَاوِيلِ - لَأَخَذْنَا مِنْهُ بِالْيَمِينِ - ثُمَّ لَقَطَعْنَا مِنْهُ الْوَتِينَ - فَمَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ عَنْهُ حَاجِزِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if he had forged a false saying concerning Us, We surely would have seized him by his right hand, and then We certainly would have cut off his aorta, and none of you could have withheld Us from <span class=\"gray\">(punishing)</span> him.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(69:44-47)</span>. 'But I am telling the truth in what I say to you about Him, so He has supported me with clear miracles and definitive evidence.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He knows what is in the heavens and the earth.)</span> means, nothing is hidden from Him at all.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِالْبَاطِلِ وَكَفَرُوا بِاللَّهِ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who believe in falsehood, and disbelieve in Allah, it is they who are the losers.)</span> means, on the Day of Resurrection, they will be punished for what they did, and will get what they justly deserve for rejecting the truth and following falsehood, for disbelieving in the Messengers of Allah even when there was proof that they were telling the truth, and for worshipping false gods with no evidence. Allah will punish them for all that, for He is All-Wise and All-Knowing.</p>"
