This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الْأَجْدَاثِ سِرَاعًا كَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَىٰ نُصُبٍ يُوفِضُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Day when they will come out of the graves quickly as racing to a goal.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(70:43)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالُوا يَا وَيْلَنَا مَنْ بَعَثَنَا مِنْ مَرْقَدِنَا ۜ ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They will say: \"Woe to us!

Ubayy bin Ka'b, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Qatadah said, \"They will sleep before the Resurrection.\" Qatadah said, \"That will be between the two trumpet blasts, they will say, 'Who has raised us up from our place of sleep?'\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When they say that, the believers will respond.
