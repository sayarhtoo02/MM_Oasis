    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And indeed We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture, and the understanding of the Scripture and its laws, and the prophethood; and provided them with good things, and preferred them above the nations <span>(16)</span>And gave them clear proofs in matters. And they differed not until after the knowledge came to them, through envy among themselves.

Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحُكْمَ وَالنُّبُوَّةَ وَرَزَقْنَاهُمْ مِنَ الطَّيِّبَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And indeed We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture, and the understanding of the Scripture and its laws, and the prophethood; and provided them with good things,)</span> such as foods and drinks,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَفَضَّلْنَاهُمْ عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and preferred them above the nations.)</span> of their time,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَآتَيْنَاهُمْ بَيِّنَاتٍ مِنَ الْأَمْرِ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And gave them clear proofs in matters.)</span> 'We gave them evidences, proofs and unequivocal signs.' Therefore, the proof has been established against them, yet they differed among themselves after the proof came to them, out of transgression against each other,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\"> إِنَّ رَبَّكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, your Lord)</span> 'O Muhammad',</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَقْضِي بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they used to differ.)</span> He will judge between them by His just judgement.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Warning to this Ummah against following the Ways of the Children of Israel</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Ayah contains a warning to the Muslim Ummah as well. It warns them not to take the path the Jews took nor adopt their ways. This is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَاكَ عَلَىٰ شَرِيعَةٍ مِنَ الْأَمْرِ فَاتَّبِعْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then We have put you on a <span class=\"gray\">(legal)</span> way of commandment. So follow you that.)</span> 'follow what was revealed to you from your Lord, O Muhammad, there is no true deity except Him, and turn away from the idolators.' Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَاءَ الَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ - إِنَّهُمْ لَنْ يُغْنُوا عَنْكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا ۚ وَإِنَّ الظَّالِمِينَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءُ بَعْضٍ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and follow not the desires of those who know not. Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allah. Verily, the wrongdoers are protecting friends of one another,)</span> Allah says, 'what will the loyalty that the idolators give each other avail them?' Indeed, all they will earn from their protecting friends is more loss, destruction and demise,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but Allah is the Protector of those who have Taqwa.)</span> and He will deliver them from the darkness to the light. In contrast, all the false deities are the protecting friends of those who disbelieve, taking them out of the light to the darkness. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَٰذَا بَصَائِرُ لِلنَّاسِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(This is a clear insight and evidence for mankind,)</span> in reference to the Qur'an,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and a guidance and a mercy for people who have faith with certainty.)</span></p>"

Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا يَسْتَوِي أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ وَأَصْحَابُ الْجَنَّةِ ۚ أَصْحَابُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمُ الْفَائِزُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(59:20)</span> Allah said here,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُوا السَّيِّئَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or do those who earn evil deeds think)</span> those who commit and practice evil,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> أَنْ نَجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ سَوَاءً مَحْيَاهُمْ وَمَمَاتُهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous good deeds, in their life and their death?)</span> treat them equally in the present life of the world and in the Hereafter?</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">سَاءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Worst is the judgement that they make.)</span> 'worst is the thought that they have about Us and about Our justice, thinking that We will ever make the pious and the wicked equal in the Hereafter or this life.' </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">At–Tabarani recorded that Shu'bah said that 'Amr bin Murrah narrated that Abu Ad-Duha said that Masruq said that Tamim Ad-Dari once stood in voluntary prayer through the night until the morning only reciting this Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُوا السَّيِّئَاتِ أَنْ نَجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or do those who earn evil deeds think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous good deeds?)</span> Allah said in reply:</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">سَاءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Worst is the judgement that they make.)</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَخَلَقَ اللَّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِالْحَقِّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth,)</span> meaning, in justice,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلِتُجْزَىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(in order that each person may be recompensed what he has earned, and they will not be wronged.)</span> Allah the Exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَٰهَهُ هَوَاهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Have you seen him who takes his own lust as his god?)</span>, who abides by his lust, and whatever his lust portrays as good he implements it, and whatever his lust portrays as evil, he abandons it! Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَضَلَّهُ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ عِلْمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah left him astray with knowledge,)</span> has two meanings. One of them is that Allah knew that this person deserves to be misguided, so He left him astray. The second meaning is that Allah led this person astray after knowledge reached him and the proof was established before him. The second meaning includes the first meaning, but not the opposite. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَخَتَمَ عَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِ وَقَلْبِهِ وَجَعَلَ عَلَىٰ بَصَرِهِ غِشَاوَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and sealed his hearing and his heart, and put a cover on his sight.)</span> so he does not hear what benefits him, understands not what would lead him to the guidance and sees not the evidence with which he can be enlightened. This is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمَنْ يَهْدِيهِ مِنْ بَعْدِ اللَّهِ ۚ أَفَلَا تَذَكَّرُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who then will guide him after Allah? Will you not then remember?)</span> Allah said in a similar Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلَا هَادِيَ لَهُ ۚ وَيَذَرُهُمْ فِي طُغْيَانِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whomsoever Allah sends astray, none can guide him; and He lets them wander blindly in their transgressions.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7:186)</span>.</p>"
