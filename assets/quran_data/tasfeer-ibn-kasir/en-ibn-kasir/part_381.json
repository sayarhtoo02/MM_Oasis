He also teaches them what they knew not. During the time of Jahiliyyah, they used to utter foolish statements. Later on, and with the blessing of the Prophet's Message and the goodness of his prophecy, they were elevated to the status of the Awliya' <span class=\"gray\">(loyal friends of Allah)</span> and the rank of the scholars.
