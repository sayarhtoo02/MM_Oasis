    "text": "<p class=\"en translation\" lang=\"en\">Say: \"If you possessed the treasure of the mercy of my Lord, then you would surely hold back for fear of spending, and man is ever miserly! <span>(100)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Holding back is Part of Man's Nature</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah says to His Messenger ﷺ: \"Tell them, O Muhammad, even if you had authority over the treasures of Allah, you would refrain from spending for fear of exhausting it.\" Ibn 'Abbas and Qatadah said, \"This means for fear of poverty,\" lest it run out, despite the fact that it can never be exhausted or come to an end. This is because it is part of your nature. So Allah says:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَكَانَ الْإِنسَانُ قَتُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and man is ever miserly.)</span> Ibn 'Abbas and Qatadah said: \"<span class=\"gray\">(This means)</span> stingy and holding back.\" Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمْ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِّنَ الْمُلْكِ فَإِذًا لَّا يُؤْتُونَ النَّاسَ نَقِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or have they a share in the dominion? Then in that case they would not give mankind even a Naqira.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:53)</span>, meaning that even if they had a share in the authority of Allah, they would not have given anything to anyone, not even the amount of a Naqira <span class=\"gray\">(speck on the back of a date stone)</span>. Allah describes man as he really is, except for those whom Allah helps and guides. Miserliness, discontent and impatience are human characteristics, as Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ خُلِقَ هَلُوعًا - إِذَا مَسَّهُ الشَّرُّ جَزُوعًا - وَإِذَا مَسَّهُ الْخَيْرُ مَنُوعًا - إِلَّا الْمُصَلِّينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, man was created very impatient; irritable when evil touches him; and stingy when good touches him. Except those who are devoted to Salah <span class=\"gray\">(prayers)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(70:19-22)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And there are many other such references in the Qur'an. This is an indication of the generosity and kindness of Allah. In the Two Sahihs it says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَدُ اللهِ مَلْأَى لَا يَغِيضُهَا نَفَقَةٌ سَحَّاءُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ، أَرَأَيْتُمْ مَا أَنْفَقَ مُنْذُ خَلَقَ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ، فَإِنَّهُ لَمْ يَغِضْ مَا فِي يَمِينِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah's Hand is full and never decreases because of His giving night and day. Do you not see how much He has given since He created the heavens and the earth, yet that which is in His right hand never decreases.)</span></p>"

I think you are indeed bewitched. <span>(101)</span>He said: \"Verily, you know that these signs have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth.

These clear signs were: his staff, his hand, the years of famine, the sea, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs and the blood. This was the view of Ibn 'Abbas. Muhammad bin Ka'b said, \"They were his hand and his staff, the five signs mentioned in Al-A'raf, and destruction of wealth and the rock.\" Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, 'Ikrimah, Ash-Sha'bi and Qatadah said: \"They are his hand, his staff, the years of famine, the failure of the crops, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs and the blood.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَاسْتَكْبَرُوا وَكَانُوا قَوْمًا مُّجْرِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were criminals,)</span><span class=\"gray\">[7:133]</span> meaning, despite all these signs and their witnessing of them, they disbelieved them and belied them wrongfully and arrogantly, although they were themselves were convinced of them, so they did not have any effect on them. By the same token, <span class=\"gray\">(Allah tells His Messenger ﷺ here,)</span> 'if We were to respond to what these people are asking you for, who have said that they will not believe in you until you cause springs to gush forth throughout the land for them, they would not respond or believe except if Allah willed.' As Fira'wn said to Musa, even though he had witnessed the signs which he brought,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">إِنِّي لَأَظُنُّكَ يَا مُوسَىٰ مَسْحُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"O Musa! I think you are indeed bewitched.\")</span> It was said that this meant he thought he was a sorcerer, but Allah knows best. These nine signs which were mentioned by the Imams <span class=\"gray\">(scholars)</span> quoted above are what is referred to here, and in the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَلْقِ عَصَاكَ ۚ فَلَمَّا رَآهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَانٌّ وَلَّىٰ مُدْبِرًا وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ ۚ يَا مُوسَىٰ لَا تَخَفْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"And throw down your stick!\" But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight, and did not look back. <span class=\"gray\">(It was said:)</span> \"O Musa ! Fear not.\")</span> until His saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِي تِسْعِ آيَاتٍ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَقَوْمِهِ ۚ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا قَوْمًا فَاسِقِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(among the nine signs <span class=\"gray\">(you will take)</span> to Fir'awn and his people. Verily, they are a people who are rebellious.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[27:10-12]</span> These Ayat include mention of the stick and the hand, and the rest of the nine signs are mentioned in detail in Surat Al-A'raf. Musa was also given many other signs, such as striking the rock with his staff and water flowing from it, their being shaded with clouds, manna and quails, and other signs which were bestowed upon the Children of Israel after they had left the land of Egypt. But here Allah mentions the nine signs which were witnessed by his people in Egypt. These became evidence against them, because they stubbornly rejected them out of disbelief. So Musa said to Fira'wn:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَا أَنزَلَ هَٰؤُلَاءِ إِلَّا رَبُّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ بَصَائِرَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Verily, you know that these signs have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth.)</span> meaning, as proof and evidence of the truth of what I have brought to you.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنِّي لَأَظُنُّكَ يَا فِرْعَوْنُ مَثْبُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And I think you are indeed, O Fir'awn, doomed to destruction!)</span> i.e., bound to be destroyed. This was the view of Mujahid and Qatadah. Ibn 'Abbas said: \"It means cursed.\" Ibn 'Abbas and Ad-Dahhak said:</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">مَثْبُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(doomed to destruction.)</span> means defeated. As Mujahid said, \"doomed\" includes all of these meanings.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Destruction of Fir'awn and His People</h2></div><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَرَادَ أَن يَسْتَفِزَّهُم مِّنَ الْأَرْضِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So he resolved to turn them out of the land.)</span> means, he wanted to expel them and drive them out.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَغْرَقْنَاهُ وَمَن مَّعَهُ جَمِيعًا - وَقُلْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِ لِبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اسْكُنُوا الْأَرْضَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But We drowned him and all who were with him. And We said to the Children of Israel after him: \"Dwell in the land...\")</span> This is good news for Muhammad ﷺ, a foretelling of the conquest of Makkah, even though this Surah was revealed in Makkah before the Hijrah. Similarly, the people of Makkah wanted to expel the Prophet ﷺ from the city, as Allah says in two Ayat:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِن كَادُوا لَيَسْتَفِزُّونَكَ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ لِيُخْرِجُوكَ مِنْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, they were about to frighten you so much as to drive you out from the land...)</span><span class=\"gray\">[17:76-77]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Hence Allah caused His Messenger ﷺ to inherit Makkah, so he entered it by force, according to the better-known of the two opinions, and he defeated its people then out of kindness and generosity, he let them go, just as Allah caused the Children of Israel, who had been oppressed, to inherit the land, east and west, and to inherit the land of Fir'awn's people, with its farmland, crops and treasures. As Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَذَٰلِكَ وَأَوْرَثْنَاهَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(thus We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(26:59)</span>. Here Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقُلْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِ لِبَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اسْكُنُوا الْأَرْضَ فَإِذَا جَاءَ وَعْدُ الْآخِرَةِ جِئْنَا بِكُمْ لَفِيفًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We said to the Children of Israel after him: \"Dwell in the land, then, when the final and the last promise comes near, We shall bring you altogether as mixed crowd.\")</span> meaning, all of you, you and your ene mies. Ibn 'Abbas, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak said, \"It means all together.\"</p>"
