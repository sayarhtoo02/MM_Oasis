Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust, but if there is any good <span class=\"gray\">(done)</span>, He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward <span>(40)</span>How <span class=\"gray\">(will it be)</span> then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad)</span> as a witness against these people <span>(41)</span>On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they were buried in the earth, but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah <span>(42)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Allah Wrongs Not Even the Weight of a Speck of Dust</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah states that He does not treat any of His servants with injustice on the Day of Resurrection, be it the weight of a mustard seed or a speck of dust. Rather, Allah shall reward them for this action and multiply it, if it were a good deed. For instance, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَنَضَعُ الْمَوَازِينَ الْقِسْطَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We shall set up balances of justice)</span><span class=\"gray\">[21:47]</span> Allah said that Luqman said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا بُنَيَّ إِنَّهَا إِن تَكُ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِّنْ خَرْدَلٍ فَتَكُن فِي صَخْرَةٍ أَوْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ أَوْ فِي الْأَرْضِ يَأْتِ بِهَا اللَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O my son! If it be <span class=\"gray\">(anything)</span> equal to the weight of a mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth)</span>. <span class=\"gray\">[31:16]</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصْدُرُ النَّاسُ أَشْتَاتًا لِّيُرَوْا أَعْمَالَهُمْ - فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُ - وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That Day mankind will proceed in scattered groups that they may be shown their deeds. So whosoever does good equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[99:6-8]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Two Sahihs recorded the long Hadith about the intercession that Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri narrated, and in which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَيَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: ارْجِعُوا، فَمَنْ وَجَدْتُمْ فِي قَلْبِهِ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةِ خَرْدَلٍ مِنْ إِيمَانٍ، فَأَخْرِجُوهُ مِنَ النَّارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah then says, \"Go back, and take out of the Fire everyone in whose heart you find the weight of a mustard seed of faith\")</span> In another narration, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وفي لفظ: أَدْنَى أَدْنَى أَدْنَى مِثْقَالِ ذَرَّةٍ مِنْ إِيمَانٍ، فَأَخْرِجُوهُ مِنَ النَّارِ، فَيُخْرِجُونَ خَلْقًا كَثِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Whosoever had the least, least, least speck of faith, take him out of the Fire,\" and they will take out many people.)</span> Abu Sa'id then said, \"Read, if you will,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust)</span>.\"</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Will Punishment be Diminished for the Disbelievers?</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Sa'id bin Jubayr commented about Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَاعِفْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but if there is any good <span class=\"gray\">(done)</span>, He doubles it,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">As for the disbeliever, his punishment will be lessened for him on the Day of Resurrection, but he will never depart the Fire. He used as evidence the authentic Hadith in which Al-'Abbas said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Your uncle Abu Talib used to protect and support you, did you benefit him at all?\" The Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نَعَمْ هُوَ فِي ضَحْضَاحٍ مِنْ نَارٍ، وَلَوْلَا أَنَا، لَكَانَ فِي الدَّرْكِ الْأَسْفَلِ مِنَ النَّارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yes. He is in a shallow area in Hell-fire, and were it not for me, he would have been in the deepest depths of the Fire.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">However, this Hadith only applies to Abu Talib, not the rest of the disbelievers. To support this, we mention what Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded in his Musnad that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ لَا يَظْلِمُ الْمُؤْمِنَ حَسَنَةً، يُثَابُ عَلَيْهَا الرِّزْقَ فِي الدُّنْيَا، وَيُجْزَى بِهَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ، وَأَمَّا الْكَافِرُ فَيُطْعَمُ بِهَا فِي الدُّنْيَا، فَإِذَا كَانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَامَةِ لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ حَسَنَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah does not wrong the faithful even concerning one good action, for he will be rewarded for it by provision in this life and awarded for it in the Hereafter. As for the disbeliever, he will be provided provision in this life for his good action, and on the Day of Resurrection, he will not have any good deed.)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>What Does 'Great Reward' Mean?</h2></div><p lang=\"hi-Latn\" class=\"hi-Latn \">Abu Hurayrah, 'Ikrimah, Sa'id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak said that Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and gives from Him a great reward.)</span> refers to Paradise. We ask Allah for His pleasure and Paradise. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu 'Uthman An-Nahdi said, \"No other person accompanied Abu Hurayrah more than I. One year, he went to Hajj before me, and I found the people of Al-Basrah saying that he narrated that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ يُضَاعِفُ الْحَسَنَةَ ألف ألف حَسَنَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah rewards the good deed with a million deeds.)</span> So I said, 'Woe to you! No person accompanied Abu Hurayrah more than I, and I never heard him narrate this Hadith!' When I wanted to meet him, I found that he had left for Hajj so I followed him to Hajj to ask him about this Hadith.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded this Hadith using another chain of narration leading to Abu 'Uthman. In this narration, Abu 'Uthman said, \"I said, 'O Abu Hurayrah! I heard my brethren in Al-Basrah claim that you narrated that you heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْزِي بِالْحَسَنَةِ ألف ألف حَسَنَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah rewards the good deed with a million deeds.)</span> Abu Hurayrah said, 'By Allah! I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ يَجْزِي بِالْحَسَنَةِ أَلْفَيْ أَلْفِ حَسَنَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah rewards the good deed with two million deeds.)</span> He then recited this Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمَا مَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But little is the enjoyment of the life of this world as compared to the Hereafter)</span>. <span class=\"gray\">[9:38]</span>\"</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Our Prophet <span class=\"gray\">(ﷺ)</span> will be a Witness Against, or For his Ummah on the Day of Resurrection, When the Disbelivers Will Wish for Death</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَكَيْفَ إِذَا جِئْنَا مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ بِشَهِيدٍ وَجِئْنَا بِكَ عَلَىٰ هَٰؤُلَاءِ شَهِيدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(How <span class=\"gray\">(will it be)</span> then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad)</span> as a witness against these people?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah describes the horrors, hardships and difficulties of the Day of Resurrection, saying, how would it be on that Day when there will be a witness from every nation, meaning the Prophets, just as Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَشْرَقَتِ الْأَرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَابُ وَجِيءَ بِالنَّبِيِّينَ وَالشُّهَدَاءِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord, and the Book will be placed <span class=\"gray\">(open)</span>; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward)</span><span class=\"gray\">[39:69]</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَوْمَ نَبْعَثُ فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ شَهِيدًا عَلَيْهِم مِّنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And <span class=\"gray\">(remember)</span> the Day when We shall raise up from every nation a witness against them from amongst themselves)</span>. <span class=\"gray\">[16:89]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari recorded that 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me, 'Recite to me.' I said, 'O Messenger of Allah! Should I recite <span class=\"gray\">(the Qur'an)</span> to you, while it was revealed to you?' He said, 'Yes, for I like to hear it from other people.' I recited Surat An-Nisa' until I reached this Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَكَيْفَ إِذَا جِئْنَا مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ بِشَهِيدٍ وَجِئْنَا بِكَ عَلَىٰ هَٰؤُلَاءِ شَهِيدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(How <span class=\"gray\">(will it be)</span> then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad)</span> as a witness against these people?)</span> He then said, 'Stop now.' I found that his eyes were tearful.\" Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَعَصَوُا الرَّسُولَ لَوْ تُسَوَّىٰ بِهِمُ الْأَرْضُ وَلَا يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they were buried in the earth, but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah.)</span> means, they will wish that the earth would open up and swallow them because of the horror of the gathering place and the disgrace, dishonor and humiliation they will suffer on that Day. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَنظُرُ الْمَرْءُ مَا قَدَّمَتْ يَدَاهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Day when man will see that <span class=\"gray\">(the deeds)</span> which his hands have sent forth)</span><span class=\"gray\">[78:40]</span> Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah.)</span> indicating that they will admit to everything they did and will not hide any of it.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Sa'id bin Jubayr said, \"A man came to Ibn 'Abbas and said to him, 'There are things that confuse me in the Qur'an.' Ibn 'Abbas said, 'What things do you have doubts about in the Qur'an?' He said, 'Not doubts, but rather confusing things.' Ibn 'Abbas said, 'Tell me what caused you confusion.' He said, 'I hear Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ لَمْ تَكُن فِتْنَتُهُمْ إِلَّا أَن قَالُوا وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There will then be no test for them but to say: \"By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[6:23]</span> but He also says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah.)</span> They have indeed hid something.' Ibn 'Abbas said, 'As for Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ لَمْ تَكُن فِتْنَتُهُمْ إِلَّا أَن قَالُوا وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There will then be no test for them but to say: \"By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.\")</span>, <span class=\"gray\">[6:23]</span> when they see that on the Day of Resurrection that Allah does not forgive, except for the people of Islam, and that He forgives the sins, no matter how big they are, except Shirk, then the Mushriks will lie. They will say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.\")</span>, <span class=\"gray\">[6:23]</span> hoping that Allah will forgive them. However, Allah will then seal their mouths, and their hands and feet will disclose what they used to do. Then,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَعَصَوُا الرَّسُولَ لَوْ تُسَوَّىٰ بِهِمُ الْأَرْضُ وَلَا يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they were buried in the earth, but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah.)</span>'\"</p>"
