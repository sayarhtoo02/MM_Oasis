He said, 'That is one who does a deed solely for Allah and he does not like for the people to praise him.'\" Others recited the word as Mukhlas, which means that he was chosen. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنِّي اصْطَفَيْتُكَ عَلَى النَّاسِ</p><p lang=\"da\" class=\"da \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, I have chosen you above men.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[7:144]</span> Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَانَ رَسُولًا نَّبِيًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and he was a Messenger, <span class=\"gray\">(and)</span> a Prophet.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah combined these two descriptions for him. For verily, he was one of the greatest Messengers and one of the five Messengers of Strong Will. They are Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, 'Isa and Muhammad. May the blessings of Allah be upon them and all of the Prophets. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَنَادَيْنَاهُ مِن جَانِبِ الطُّورِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We called him from the side of the Tur.)</span> means Mount</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْأَيْمَنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(right)</span> It was on the right side of Musa when he went seeking a burning wood from that fire. He saw its glow in the distance, so he set out towards it and found it on the right side of the mountain from his direction, at the edge of the valley that he was in. This is when Allah, the Exalted, spoke to him and called out to him. Allah summoned him to come near and He conversed Ayah with him. Concerning His statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ مِن رَّحْمَتِنَا أَخَاهُ هَارُونَ نَبِيًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We granted him his brother Harun, <span class=\"gray\">(also)</span> a Prophet, out of Our mercy.)</span> This means, \"We responded to his request and his plea on behalf of his brother and We made him a Prophet as well.\" This is as Allah says in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَخِي هَارُونُ هُوَ أَفْصَحُ مِنِّي لِسَانًا فَأَرْسِلْهُ مَعِيَ رِدْءًا يُصَدِّقُنِي ۖ إِنِّي أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And my brother Harun he is more eloquent in speech than me: so send him with me as a helper to confirm me.Verily, I fear that they will belie me.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[28:34]</span> Also, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يَا مُوسَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(Allah said: )</span> \"You are granted your request, O Musa.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[20:36]</span> He also said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَرْسِلْ إِلَىٰ هَارُونَ - وَلَهُمْ عَلَيَّ ذَنبٌ فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So send for Harun.

    "text": "<p class=\"en translation\" lang=\"en\">And mention in the Book, Isma'il. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, <span class=\"gray\">(and)</span> a Prophet <span>(54)</span>And he would enjoin on his family and his people the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him <span>(55)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Mentioning Isma'il</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Here Allah has commended Isma'il, the son of Ibrahim, the Friend of Allah. He <span class=\"gray\">(Isma'il)</span> is the father of all of the Arabs of the Hijaz because he was true to what he promised. Ibn Jurayj said, \"He did not make any promise to his Lord, except that he fulfilled it.\" He never obligated himself to do any act of worship with a vow, except that he fulfilled it and carried it out, giving it its full due. Some said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">صَادِقَ الْوَعْدِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(he was)</span> true to what he promised.)</span> \"This was said about him because he said to his father,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَتَجِدُنِي إِن شَاءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّابِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If Allah wills you will find me of the patient.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[37:102]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So he was truthful in that.\" Being true to one's promise is one of the praiseworthy characteristics, just as breaking one's promise is of the detested characteristics. Allah, the Exalted, says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لِمَ تَقُولُونَ مَا لَا تَفْعَلُونَ - كَبُرَ مَقْتًا عِندَ اللَّهِ أَن تَقُولُوا مَا لَا تَفْعَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do? Most hateful it is with Allah that you say that which you do not do.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[61:2-3]</span></p><p lang=\"no\" class=\"no \">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">آيَةُ الْمُنَافِقِ ثَلَاثٌ: إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإِذَا وَعَدَ أَخْلَفَ، وَإِذَا ائْتُمِنَ خَانَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The sign of the hypocrite is three things. When he speaks, he lies; when he promises, he breaks his promise; and when he is entrusted with something, he is disloyal to his trust.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Thus, if these are the characteristics of the hypocrites, then behaving contrary to these is a characteristic of the true believer. For this reason, Allah commended His servant and Messenger Isma'il, for he was true to his promise. Likewise, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was true to his promise. He did not promise anyone anything, except that he fulfilled his promise to that person. He also commended Abu Al-'As bin Ar-Rabi', the husband of his daughter Zaynab, by saying,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">حَدَّثَنِي فَصَدَقَنِي، وَوَعَدَنِي فَوَفَى لِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He spoke to me and he told me the truth, and he promised me and he fulfilled his promise to me.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When the Prophet ﷺ died, the Khalifah <span class=\"gray\">(his successor)</span>, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, \"Whoever received any promise from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ or was owed any debt by him, then let him come to me and I will fulfill it on his behalf.\" So Jabir bin 'Abdullah came and related that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَوْ قَدْ جَاءَ مَالُ الْبَحْرَينِ أَعْطَيْتُكَ هَكَذَا وَهَكَذَا وَهَكَذَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If the wealth of Bahrain comes <span class=\"gray\">(to me)</span>, then I would give you such and such and such.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This meant that he would fill his hands with wealth. Therefore, when the wealth of Bahrain came <span class=\"gray\">(to them)</span>, Abu Bakr commanded Jabir to come and fill his hands from that wealth. Then, he commanded him to do so again, until he collected five hundred Dirhams. Then, Abu Bakr gave him its double along with it.<span class=\"gray\">(i.e. one thousand extra Dirhams)</span>. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَانَ رَسُولًا نَّبِيًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and he was a Messenger, <span class=\"gray\">(and)</span> a Prophet.)</span> In this is a proof of Isma'il's favored status over his brother, Ishaq. Ishaq was only described as being a Prophet, but Isma'il was described with both prophethood and messengership. It is confirmed in Sahih Muslim that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ اصْطَفَى مِنْ وَلَدِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِسْمَاعِيلَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah chose Isma'il from the sons of Ibrahim...)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then, Imam Muslim mentions the rest of the Hadith in its entirety. However, this statement proves the correctness of what we have said. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَانَ يَأْمُرُ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّلَاةِ وَالزَّكَاةِ وَكَانَ عِندَ رَبِّهِ مَرْضِيًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And he would enjoin on his family and his people the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is also a beautiful form of praise, a commendable quality, and and upright characteristic. He was commanded in this way because of his persistence in obedience of his Lord, and enjoining his family to do so.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is as Allah said to His Messenger ﷺ,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِالصَّلَاةِ وَاصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And enjoin the Salah on your family, and be patient with them.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[20:132]</span> Also, Allah, the Exalted, said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قُوا أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَارًا وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ عَلَيْهَا مَلَائِكَةٌ غِلَاظٌ شِدَادٌ لَّا يَعْصُونَ اللَّهَ مَا أَمَرَهُمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe! Protect yourselves and your families against a Fire <span class=\"gray\">(Hell)</span> whose fuel is men and stones, over which are <span class=\"gray\">(appointed)</span> angels stern <span class=\"gray\">(and)</span> severe, who disobey not, <span class=\"gray\">(from executing)</span> the commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[66:6]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This means to command them to do good, forbid them from evil and do not neglect them. If you do so, and they obey your command, the Fire <span class=\"gray\">(of Hell)</span> will not devour them on the Day of Resurrection. It has been reported in a Hadith from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَحِمَ اللهُ رَجُلًا قَامَ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَصَلَّى وَأَيْقَظَ امْرَأَتَهُ، فَإِنْ أَبَتْ نَضَحَ فِي وَجْهِهَا الْمَاءَ. رَحِمَ اللهُ امْرَأَةً قَامَتْ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَصَلَّتْ وَأَيْقَظَتْ زَوْجَهَا، فَإِنْ أَبَى نَضَحَتْ فِي وَجْهِهِ الْمَاءَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(May Allah have mercy upon a man who gets up at night to pray and he wakes his wife. If she refuses to get up, he sprinkles water in her face. May Allah have mercy upon a woman who gets up at night to pray and she wakes her husband. If he refuses to get up, she sprinkles water in his face.)</span> This Hadith was recorded by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah.</p>"
