    "text": "<p class=\"en translation\" lang=\"en\">And Allah created you and then He will cause you to die; and among you there are some who are sent back to senility, so that they know nothing after having known <span class=\"gray\">(much)</span>. Truly, Allah is Knowing, capable of all things <span>(70)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>In Man there is a Lesson</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah tells us that He is controlling the affairs of His servants. He is the One Who created them out of nothing, then He will cause them to die. But there are some of them that He allows to grow old, which is a physical weakness, as Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُم مِّن ضَعْفٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ ضَعْفٍ قُوَّةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah is He Who created you in <span class=\"gray\">(a state of)</span> weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave <span class=\"gray\">(you)</span> weakness)</span><span class=\"gray\">(30:54)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِكَيْ لَا يَعْلَمَ بَعْدَ عِلْمٍ شَيْئًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so that they know nothing after having known.)</span> meaning, after he knew things, he will reach a stage where he knows nothing because of weakness of mind due to old age and senility. Thus Al-Bukhari, when commenting on this Ayah, reported a narration from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to pray:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْبُخْلِ وَالْكَسَلِ وَالْهَرَمِ، وَأَرْذَلِ الْعُمُرِ وَعَذَابِ الْقَبْرِ، وَفِتْنَةِ الدَّجَّالِ وَفِتْنَةِ الْمَحْيَا وَالْمَمَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I seek refuge with You from miserliness, laziness, old age, senility, the punishment of the grave, the Fitnah of the Dajjal and the trials of life and death.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma said, in his famous Mu'allaqah: \"I became exhausted from the responsibilities of life. Whoever lives for eighty years, no wonder he is tired. I saw death hitting people like a crazed camel, and whoever it hit dies, but whoever is not hit lives until he grows old.\"</p>"

    "text": "<p class=\"en translation\" lang=\"en\">And Allah honored some of you over others with wealth and properties. Then, those who are so honored will by no means hand over their wealth and properties to those <span class=\"gray\">(captives of war)</span> whom their right hands possess, so that they may be equal with them in that. Do they then deny the favor of Allah <span>(71)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>There is a Sign and a Blessing in Matters of People's Livelihood</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah explains to the idolators the ignorance and disbelief involved in their claim that Allah has partners while also admitting that these partners are His servants. In their Talbiyah for Hajj, they used to say, \"Here I am, there are no partners for You except Your own partner, You own him and everything he owns.\" Allah says, denouncing them: 'You would not accept for your servant to have an equal share in your wealth, so how is it that Allah would accept His servant to be His equal in divinity and glory? As Allah says elsewhere:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ضَرَبَ لَكُم مَّثَلًا مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ ۖ هَل لَّكُم مِّن مَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُم مِّن شُرَكَاءَ فِي مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ فَأَنتُمْ فِيهِ سَوَاءٌ تَخَافُونَهُمْ كَخِيفَتِكُمْ أَنفُسَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He sets forth a parable for you from yourselves: Do you have partners among those whom your right hands possess <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. your servant)</span> to share as equals in the wealth We have granted you, those whom you fear as you fear each other?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(30:28)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-'Awfi reported that Ibn 'Abbas mentioned this Ayah, saying, \"Allah is saying - 'If they did not want their servant to have a share with them in their wealth and wives, how can My servant have a share with Me in My power?' Thus Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَبِنِعْمَةِ اللَّهِ يَجْحَدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do they then deny the favor of Allah?)</span>\" According to another report, Ibn 'Abbas said: \"How can they accept for Me that which they do not accept for themselves?\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَبِنِعْمَةِ اللَّهِ يَجْحَدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do they then deny the favor of Allah?)</span> meaning, they assign to Allah a share of the tilth and cattle which He has created. They denied His blessings and associated others in worship with Him. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said: \"Umar bin Al-Khattab wrote this letter to Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari: 'Be content with your provision in this world, for the Most Merciful has honored some of His servants over others in terms of provision as a test of both. The one who has been given plenty is being tested to see if he will give thanks to Allah and fulfill the duties which are his by virtue of his wealth...'\" It was reported by Ibn Abi Hatim.</p>"

Do they then believe in false deities and deny favor of Allah <span>(72)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Among His Blessings and Signs are Mates, Children and Grandchildren</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah mentions the blessing He has bestowed upon His servant by giving them mates from among themselves, mates of their own kind. If He had given them mates of another kind, there would be no harmony, love and mercy between them. But out of His mercy He has made the Children of Adam male and female, and has made the females wives or mates for the males. Then Allah mentions that from these wives He creates children and grandchildren, one's children's children. This was the opinion of Ibn 'Abbas, 'Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Shu'bah said, narrating from Abu Bishr from Sa'id bin Jubayr from Ibn 'Abbas: \"Children and grandchildren, who are one's children and one's children's children.\" It was also said that this means servants and helpers, or it means sons-in-law or in-laws. I say: if we understand</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَحَفَدَةً </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(grandsons)</span> to refer back to wives, then it must mean children, children's children, and sons-in-law, because they are the husbands of one's daughter or the children of one's wife.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَرَزَقَكُم مِّنَ الطَّيِّبَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and has granted you good provisions.)</span> meaning your food and drink. Then Allah denounces those who associate others in worship with the One Who bestows blessings on them:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَبِالْبَاطِلِ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do they then believe in false deities)</span>, meaning idols and rivals to Allah</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَبِنِعْمَتِ اللَّهِ هُمْ يَكْفُرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and deny the favor of Allah?)</span> meaning, by concealing the blessings that Allah has given them and attributing them to others. According to a Sahih Hadith, the Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ يَقُولُ لِلْعَبْدِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ مُمْتَنًّا عَلَيْهِ: أَلَمْ أُزَوِّجْكَ؟ أَلَمْ أُكْرِمْكَ؟ أَلَمْ أُسَخِّرْ لَكَ الْخَيْلَ وَالْإِبِلَ، وَأَذَرْكَ تَرْأَسُ وَتَرْبَعُ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah will say to His servant on the Day of Resurrection, reminding him of His blessings: \"Did I not give you a wife? Did I not honor you? Did I not subject horses and camels to your use, and cause you to occupy a position of leadership and honor?\")</span></p>"

He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا لَا يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ رِزْقًا مِّنَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ شَيْئًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(such as do not have power to grant them any provision from the heavens or the earth)</span> meaning, nobody can cause rain to fall, or make plants and trees grow.

The servant who has no power over anything is like the disbeliever, and the one who is given good provisions and spends of them secretly and openly is like the believer. Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid said: \"This is an example given of the idol and the True God - can they be the same?\" Once the difference between them is so clear and so obvious, no one can be unaware of it except the one who is foolish.
