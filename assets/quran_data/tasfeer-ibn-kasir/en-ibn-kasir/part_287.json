No doubt, whoever does that, Allah will have mercy on him, as Allah says in another Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُولَٰئِكَ سَيَرْحَمُهُمُ اللَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah will have His mercy on them)</span><span class=\"gray\">(9:71)</span></p><p class=\"no qpc-hafs\" lang=\"no\">لَا تَحْسَبَنَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Consider not)</span> means, 'do not think, O Muhammad,' that:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(the disbelievers)</span> meaning, those who opposed and denied you,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مُعْجِزِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(can escape in the land.)</span> means, that they can flee from Allah. No, Allah is able to deal with them and He will punish them most severely for that. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَأْوَاهُمُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Their abode)</span> meaning, in the Hereafter,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">النَّارُ ۖ وَلَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(shall be the Fire – and worst indeed is that destination.)</span> means, how terrible the consequences will be for the disbelievers, how evil a place to stay in and how awful a place to rest!</p>"

    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">O you who believe! Let your slaves and slave-girls, and those among you who have not come to the age of puberty ask your permission on three occasions: before the Fajr prayer, and while you put off your clothes during the afternoon, and after the 'Isha' prayer. <span class=\"gray\">(These)</span> three <span class=\"gray\">(times)</span> are of privacy for you; other than these times there is no sin on you or on them to move about, attending to each other. Thus Allah makes clear the Ayat to you. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise <span>(58)</span>And when the children among you come to puberty, then let them <span class=\"gray\">(also)</span> ask for permission, as those senior to them <span class=\"gray\">(in age)</span> ask permission. Thus Allah makes clear His Ayat for you. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise <span>(59)</span>And the Qawa'id among women who do not hope for marriage, it is no sin on them if they discard their <span class=\"gray\">(outer)</span> clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment. But to refrain is better for them. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower <span>(60)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Times When Servants and Young Children Should Seek Permission to Enter</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">These Ayat include a discussion of how people who are closely related should seek permission to enter upon one another. What was mentioned earlier in the Surah had to do with how unrelated people should seek permission to enter upon one another. Allah commanded the believers to ensure that their servants and their children who have not yet reached puberty should seek permission at three times: the first is before the Fajr prayer, because people are asleep in their beds at that time.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَحِينَ تَضَعُونَ ثِيَابَكُم مِّنَ الظَّهِيرَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and while you put off your clothes during the afternoon,)</span> means, at the time of rest, because a man may be in a state of undress with his wife at that time.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِن بَعْدِ صَلَاةِ الْعِشَاءِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and after the 'Isha' prayer.)</span> because this is the time for sleep. Servants and children are commanded not to enter upon household members at these times, because it is feared that a man may be in an intimate situation with his wife and so on. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثَلَاثُ عَوْرَاتٍ لَّكُمْ ۚ لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَلَا عَلَيْهِمْ جُنَاحٌ بَعْدَهُنَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(These)</span> three <span class=\"gray\">(times)</span> are of privacy for you; other than these times there is no sin on you or on them)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">If they enter at a time other than these, there is no sin on you if you let them enter, and no sin on them if they see something at a time other than these times. They have been given permission to enter suddenly, because they are those who go around in the house, i.e., to serve you etc., and as such they may be forgiven for things that others will not be forgiven. Although this Ayah is quite clear and has not been abrogated, people hardly follow it, and 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas denounced the people for that.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abu Dawud recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said: \"Most of the people do not follow it, the Ayah that speaks about asking permission, but I tell my servant woman to seek permission to enter.\" Abu Dawud said: 'Ata' also narrated that Ibn 'Abbas commanded this. Ath-Thawri narrated that Musa bin Abi 'A'ishah said, \"I asked Ash-Sha'bi <span class=\"gray\">[about the Ayah]</span>:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِيَسْتَأْذِنكُمُ الَّذِينَ مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Let your slaves and slave-girls ask your permission.)</span> He said, 'It has not been abrogated.' I said: 'But the people do not do that.' He said, 'May Allah help them.'\" Then Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا بَلَغَ الْأَطْفَالُ مِنكُمُ الْحُلُمَ فَلْيَسْتَأْذِنُوا كَمَا اسْتَأْذَنَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when the children among you come to puberty, then let them <span class=\"gray\">(also)</span> ask for permission, as those senior to them <span class=\"gray\">(in age)</span>)</span> meaning: when the children who used to seek permission at the three times of privacy reach puberty, then they have to seek permission at all times, i.e., with regard to those who are non-relatives, and at times when a man may be in a state of intimacy with his wife, even if it is not one of the three times stated above.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>There Is No Sin on Elderly Women If They Do Not Wear a Cloak</h2></div><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْقَوَاعِدُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the Qawa'id among women.)</span> Sa'id bin Jubayr, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah said that these are the women who no longer think that they can bear children,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللَّاتِي لَا يَرْجُونَ نِكَاحًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(who do not hope for marriage,)</span> meaning, they no longer have any desire for marriage,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْهِنَّ جُنَاحٌ أَن يَضَعْنَ ثِيَابَهُنَّ غَيْرَ مُتَبَرِّجَاتٍ بِزِينَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(it is no sin on them if they discard their <span class=\"gray\">(outer)</span> clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment.)</span> meaning, they do not have to cover themselves in the same way that other women have to. Abu Dawud recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said that the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِنَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And tell the believing women to lower their gaze)</span><span class=\"gray\">[24:31]</span> was abrogated and an exception was made in the case of:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْقَوَاعِدُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ اللَّاتِي لَا يَرْجُونَ نِكَاحًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(the past childbearing among women who do not hope for marriage,)</span></p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْهِنَّ جُنَاحٌ أَن يَضَعْنَ ثِيَابَهُنَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(it is no sin on them if they discard their <span class=\"gray\">(outer)</span> clothing)</span> Ibn Mas'ud said about <span class=\"gray\">(outer)</span> clothing,, \"The Jilbab or Rida'.\" A similar view was also narrated from Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn 'Umar, Mujahid, Sa'id bin Jubayr, Abu Ash-Sha'tha', Ibrahim An-Nakha'i, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Az-Zuhri, Al-'Awza'i and others.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">غَيْرَ مُتَبَرِّجَاتٍ بِزِينَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(in such a way as not to show their adornment.)</span> Sa'id bin Jubayr said, \"They should not make a wanton display of themselves by removing their outer garment so that their adornment may be seen.\"</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَأَن يَسْتَعْفِفْنَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُنَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But to refrain is better for them.)</span> means, not removing their outer garment, even though that is permissible for them, is better for them.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"fy\" class=\"fy \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.)</span></p>"
