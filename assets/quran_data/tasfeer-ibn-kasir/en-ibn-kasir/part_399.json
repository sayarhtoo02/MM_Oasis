Truly, Allah likes not the transgressors <span>(190)</span>And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.

But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimin <span class=\"gray\">(the polytheists and wrongdoers)</span><span>(193)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Command to fight Those Who fight Muslims and killing Them wherever They are found</h2></div><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">Abu Ja'far Ar-Razi said that Ar-Rabi' bin Anas said that Abu Al-'Aliyah commented on what Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَاتِلُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ الَّذِينَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And fight in the way of Allah those who fight you,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abu Al-'Aliyah said, \"This was the first Ayah about fighting that was revealed in Al-Madinah. Ever since it was revealed, Allah's Messenger ﷺ used to fight only those who fought him and avoid non-combatants. Later, Surat Bara'ah <span class=\"gray\">(chapter 9 in the Qur'an)</span> was revealed.\" 'Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said similarly, then he said that this was later abrogated by the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَاقْتُلُوا الْمُشْرِكِينَ حَيْثُ وَجَدتُّمُوهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(then kill them wherever you find them)</span><span class=\"gray\">(9:5)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">However, this statement is not plausible, because Allah's statement:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...those who fight you)</span> applies only to fighting the enemies who are engaged in fighting Islam and its people. So the Ayah means, 'Fight those who fight you', just as Allah said <span class=\"gray\">(in another Ayah)</span>:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَاتِلُوا الْمُشْرِكِينَ كَافَّةً كَمَا يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ كَافَّةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...and fight against the Mushrikin collectively as they fight against you collectively.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(9:36)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is why Allah said later in the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثَقِفْتُمُوهُمْ وَأَخْرِجُوهُم مِّنْ حَيْثُ أَخْرَجُوكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out.)</span> meaning, 'Your energy should be spent on fighting them, just as their energy is spent on fighting you, and on expelling them from the areas from which they have expelled you, as a law of equality in punishment.'</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Prohibition of mutilating the Dead and stealing from the captured Goods</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَعْتَدُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُعْتَدِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allah likes not the transgressors.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Ayah means, 'Fight for the sake of Allah and do not be transgressors,' such as, by committing prohibitions. Al-Hasan Al-Basri stated that transgression <span class=\"gray\">(indicated by the Ayah)</span>, \"includes mutilating the dead, theft <span class=\"gray\">(from the captured goods)</span>, killing women, children and old people who do not participate in warfare, killing priests and residents of houses of worship, burning down trees and killing animals without real benefit.\" This is also the opinion of Ibn 'Abbas, 'Umar bin 'Abdul-'Aziz, Muqatil bin Hayyan and others. Muslim recorded in his Sahih that Buraydah narrated that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اغْزُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ، قَاتِلُوا مَنْ كَفَرَ بِاللهِ، اغْزُوا وَلَا تَغُلُّوا وَلَا تَغْدِرُوا وَلَا تَـمْثُلُوا وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا وَلِيدًا وَلَا أَصْحَابَ الصَّوَامِعِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Fight for the sake of Allah and fight those who disbelieve in Allah. Fight, but do not steal <span class=\"gray\">(from the captured goods)</span>, commit treachery, mutilate <span class=\"gray\">(the dead)</span>, or kill a child, or those who reside in houses of worship.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Ibn 'Umar said, \"A woman was found dead during one of the Prophet's battles and the Prophet ﷺ then forbade killing women and children. \" There are many other Hadiths on this subject.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Shirk is worse than Killing</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Since Jihad involves killing and shedding the blood of men, Allah indicated that these men are committing disbelief in Allah, associating with Him <span class=\"gray\">(in the worship)</span> and hindering from His path, and this is a much greater evil and more disastrous than killing. Abu Malik commented about what Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.)</span> Meaning what you <span class=\"gray\">(disbelievers)</span> are committing is much worse than killing.\" Abu Al-'Aliyah, Mujahid, Sa'id bin Jubayr, 'Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ar-Rabi' bin Anas said that what Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ</p><p lang=\"fil\" class=\"fil \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.)</span> \"Shirk <span class=\"gray\">(polytheism)</span> is worse than killing.\"</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Fighting in the Sacred Area is prohibited, except in Self-Defense</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تُقَاتِلُوهُمْ عِندَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And fight not with them at Al-Masjid Al-Haram <span class=\"gray\">(the sanctuary at Makkah)</span>)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It is reported in the Two Sahihs that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إنَّ هَذَا الْبَلَدَ حَرَّمَهُ اللهُ يَوْمَ خَلَقَ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ، فَهُوَ حَرَامٌ بِحُرْمَةِ اللهِ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ، وَلَمْ يَحِلَّ لِي إِلَّا سَاعَةً مِنْ نَهَارٍ، وَإِنَّهَا سَاعَتِي هذِهِ حَرامٌ بحُرْمَةِ اللهِ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيامَةِ، لا يُعْضَدُ شَجَرُهُ، وَلَا يُخْتَلىَ خَلَاهُ، فَإِنْ أَحَدٌ تَرَخَّصَ بِقِتَالِ رَسُولِ اللهِ صلّى الله عليه وسلّم، فَقُولُوا: إنَّ اللهَ أَذِنَ لِرَسُولِهِ وَلَمْ يَأْذَنْ لَكُم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah has made this city a sanctuary since the day He created the heavens and the earth. So, it is a sanctuary by Allah's decree till the Day of Resurrection. Fighting in it was made legal for me only for an hour in the daytime. So, it <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., Makkah)</span> is a sanctuary, by Allah's decree, from now on until the Day of Resurrection. Its trees should not be cut, and its grass should not be uprooted. If anyone mentions the fighting in it that occurred by Allah's Messenger, then say that Allah allowed His Messenger, but did not allow you.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In this Hadith, Allah's Messenger ﷺ mentions fighting the people of Makkah when he conquered it by force, leading to some deaths among the polytheists in the area of the Khandamah. This occurred after the Prophet ﷺ proclaimed:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ أَغْلَقَ بَابَهُ فهُوَ آمِنٌ، وَمَنْ دَخَلَ الْمَسْجِدَ فَهُو آمِنٌ، ومَنْ دَخَلَ دَارَ أَبِي سُفْيَانَ فَهُوَ آمِنٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever closed his door is safe. Whoever entered the <span class=\"gray\">(Sacred)</span> Mosque is safe. Whoever entered the house of Abu Sufyan is also safe.)</span></p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَتَّىٰ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ فِيهِ فَإِن قَاتَلُوكُمْ فَاقْتُلُوهُمْ كَذَٰلِكَ جَزَاءُ الْكَافِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...unless they <span class=\"gray\">(first)</span> fight you there. But if they attack you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah states: 'Do not fight them in the area of the Sacred Mosque unless they start fighting you in it. In this case, you are allowed to fight them and kill them to stop their aggression.' Hence, Allah's Messenger ﷺ took the pledge from his Companions under the tree <span class=\"gray\">(in the area of Al-Hudaybiyyah)</span> to fight <span class=\"gray\">(the polytheists)</span>, after the tribes of Quraysh and their allies, Thaqif and other groups, collaborated against the Muslims <span class=\"gray\">(to stop them from entering Makkah to visit the Sacred House)</span>. Then, Allah stopped the fighting before it started between them and said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ الَّذِي كَفَّ أَيْدِيَهُمْ عَنكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ عَنْهُم بِبَطْنِ مَكَّةَ مِن بَعْدِ أَنْ أَظْفَرَكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He it is Who has withheld their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makkah, after He had made you victors over them.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(48:24)</span> and:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْلَا رِجَالٌ مُّؤْمِنُونَ وَنِسَاءٌ مُّؤْمِنَاتٌ لَّمْ تَعْلَمُوهُمْ أَن تَطَئُوهُمْ فَتُصِيبَكُم مِّنْهُم مَّعَرَّةٌ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ لِّيُدْخِلَ اللَّهُ فِي رَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَاءُ لَوْ تَزَيَّلُوا لَعَذَّبْنَا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know, that you may kill them and on whose account a sin would have been committed by you without <span class=\"gray\">(your)</span> knowledge, that Allah might bring into His mercy whom He wills ـ if they <span class=\"gray\">(the believers and the disbelievers)</span> had been apart, We verily, would have punished those of them who disbelieved with painful torment.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(48:25)</span></p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">فَإِنِ انتَهَوْا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But if they cease, then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)</span> which means, 'If they <span class=\"gray\">(polytheists)</span> cease fighting you in the Sacred Area, and come to Islam and repent, then Allah will forgive them their sins, even if they had before killed Muslims in Allah's Sacred Area.' Indeed, Allah's forgiveness encompasses every sin, whatever its enormity, when the sinner repents it.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Order to fight until there is no more Fitnah</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah then commanded fighting the disbelievers when He said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...until there is no more Fitnah)</span> meaning, Shirk. This is the opinion of Ibn 'Abbas, Abu Al-'Aliyah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi', Muqatil bin Hayyan, As-Suddi and Zayd bin Aslam.</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ لِلَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...and the religion <span class=\"gray\">(all and every kind of worship)</span> is for Allah <span class=\"gray\">(Alone)</span>.)</span> means, 'So that the religion of Allah becomes dominant above all other religions.' It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari said: \"The Prophet ﷺ was asked, 'O Allah's Messenger! A man fights out of bravery, and another fights to show off, which of them fights in the cause of Allah?' The Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ قَاتَلَ لِتَكُونَ كَلِمَةُ اللهِ هِيَ الْعُلْيا فَهُوَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He who fights so that Allah's Word is superior, then he fights in Allah's cause.)</span> In addition, it is reported in the Two Sahihs:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أُقَاتِلَ النَّاسَ حَتَّى يَقُولُوا لَا إِلهَ إلَّا اللهُ، فَإِذَا قَالُوهَا عَصَمُوا مِنِّي دِمَاءَهُم وَأَمْوَالَهُمْ إلَّا بِحَقِّهَا وَحِسَابُهُمْ عَلَى اللهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I have been ordered <span class=\"gray\">(by Allah)</span> to fight the people until they proclaim, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah'. Whoever said it, then he will save his life and property from me, except for cases of the law, and their account will be with Allah.)</span></p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِنِ انتَهَوْا فَلَا عُدْوَانَ إِلَّا عَلَى الظَّالِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against the wrongdoers.)</span> indicates that, 'If they stop their Shirk and fighting the believers, then cease warfare against them. Whoever fights them afterwards will be committing an injustice. Verily aggression can only be started against the unjust.' This is the meaning of Mujahid's statement that only combatants should be fought. Or, the meaning of the Ayah indicates that, 'If they abandon their injustice, which is Shirk in this case, then do not start aggression against them afterwards.' The aggression here means retaliating and fighting them, just as Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمَنِ اعْتَدَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ فَاعْتَدُوا عَلَيْهِ بِمِثْلِ مَا اعْتَدَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then whoever transgresses against you, you transgress likewise against him.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:194)</span></p><p lang=\"fil\" class=\"fil \">Similarly, Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَزَاءُ سَيِّئَةٍ سَيِّئَةٌ مِّثْلُهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The recompense for an evil is an evil like thereof.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(42:40)</span>, and:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنْ عَاقَبْتُمْ فَعَاقِبُوا بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبْتُم بِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if you punish them, then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(16:126)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ikrimah and Qatadah stated, \"The unjust person is he who refuses to proclaim, 'There is no God worthy of worship except Allah'.\"</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Under Allah's statement:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And fight them until there is no more Fitnah)</span> Al-Bukhari recorded that Nafi' said that two men came to Ibn 'Umar during the conflict of Ibn Az-Zubayr and said to him, \"The people have fallen into shortcomings and you are the son of 'Umar and the Prophet's Companion. Hence, what prevents you from going out?\" He said, \"What prevents me is that Allah has forbidden shedding the blood of my <span class=\"gray\">(Muslim)</span> brother.\" They said, \"Did not Allah say:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And fight them until there is no more Fitnah <span class=\"gray\">(disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah)</span>)</span>?\" He said, \"We did fight until there was no more Fitnah and the religion became for Allah Alone. You want to fight until there is Fitnah and the religion becomes for other than Allah!\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Uthman bin Salih added that a man came to Ibn 'Umar and asked him, \"O Abu 'Abdur-Rahman! What made you perform Hajj one year and 'Umrah another year and abandon Jihad in the cause of Allah, although you know how much He has encouraged performing it?\" He said, \"O my nephew! Islam is built on five <span class=\"gray\">(pillars)</span>: believing in Allah and His Messenger, the five daily prayers, fasting Ramadan, paying the Zakah and performing Hajj <span class=\"gray\">(pilgrimage)</span> to the House.\" They said, \"O Abu 'Abdur-Rahman! Did you not hear what Allah said in His Book:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِن طَائِفَتَانِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ اقْتَتَلُوا فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَهُمَا فَإِن بَغَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا عَلَى الْأُخْرَىٰ فَقَاتِلُوا الَّتِي تَبْغِي حَتَّىٰ تَفِيءَ إِلَىٰ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if two parties <span class=\"gray\">(or groups)</span> among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both.

When Islam became stronger <span class=\"gray\">(and apparent)</span>, there was no more Fitnah.\" He asked, \"What do you say about 'Ali and 'Uthman?\" He said, \"As for 'Uthman, Allah has forgiven him. However, you hated the fact that Allah had forgiven him! As for 'Ali, he is the cousin of Allah's Messenger ﷺ and his son-in-law.\" He then pointed with his hand, saying, \"This is where his house is located <span class=\"gray\">(meaning, 'so close to the Prophet's house just as 'Ali was so close to the Prophet ﷺ himself')</span>.\"</p>"
