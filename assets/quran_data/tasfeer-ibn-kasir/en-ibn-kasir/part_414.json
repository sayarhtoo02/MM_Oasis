When he was about to march, he started crying for the thought of missing Allah's Messenger ﷺ. Consequently, the Messenger ﷺ relieved Abu 'Ubaydah from command, appointed 'Abdullah bin Jahsh instead, gave him some written instructions and commanded him not to read the instructions until he reached such and such area. He also said to 'Abdullah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا تُكْرِهَنَّ أَحَدًا عَلَى السَّيْرِ مَعَكَ مِنْ أَصْحَابِكَ.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do not compel any of your men to continue marching with you thereafter.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When 'Abdullah read the instructions, he recited Istirja' <span class=\"gray\">[saying, 'Truly! to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return'; and refer to <span class=\"gray\">(2:156)</span>]</span> and said, \"I hear and obey Allah and His Messenger.\" He then told his companions the story and read the instructions to them, and two men went back while the rest remained. Soon after, they found Ibn Hadrami <span class=\"gray\">(one of the disbelievers of Quraysh)</span> and killed him not knowing that that day was in Rajab or Jumadi <span class=\"gray\">(where Rajab is the Sacred Month)</span>. The polytheists said to the Muslims, \"You have committed murder in the Sacred Month.\" Allah then revealed:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months. Say, \"Fighting therein is a great <span class=\"gray\">(transgression)</span>...\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abdul-Malik bin Hisham, who compiled the Sirah <span class=\"gray\">(life story of the Prophet ﷺ)</span>, related that Ziyad bin 'Abdullah Bakka'i said that Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar Al-Madani wrote in his book on the Sirah, \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ sent 'Abdullah bin Jahsh bin Riyab Al-Asadi in Rajab, after he <span class=\"gray\">(the Prophet ﷺ)</span> came back from the first battle of Badr. The Prophet ﷺ sent eight people with him, all from among the Muhajirun and none from the Ansar. He also gave him some written instructions and ordered him not to read them until he marched for two days. 'Abdullah should then read the instructions and march to implement them, but should not force any of those who were with him to accompany him.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The companions of 'Abdullah bin Jahsh were all from the Muhajirun, from the tribe of Banu 'Abd Shams bin 'Abd Manaf, there was Abu Hudhayfah bin 'Utbah bin Rabi'ah bin 'Abd Shams bin 'Abd Manaf. From their allies, there was 'Abdullah bin Jahsh, who was the commander of the army unit, and 'Ukkashah bin Mihsan from the tribe of Banu Asad bin Khuzaymah. From the tribe of Banu Nawfal bin 'Abd Manaf, there was 'Utbah bin Ghazwan bin Jabir, one of their allies. From the tribe of Banu Zuhrah bin Kilab, there was Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas. From Banu Ka'b, there were their allies: 'Adi bin 'Amr bin Ar-Rabi'ah not from the tribe of Ibn Wa'il; Waqid bin 'Abdullah bin 'Abd Manaf bin 'Arin bin Tha'labah bin Yarbu' from Banu Tamim; and Khalid bin Bukair from the tribe of Banu Sa'd bin Layth, Suhayl bin Bayda' from Banu Al-Harith bin Fihr was also among them. When 'Abdullah bin Jahsh marched for two days, he opened and read the <span class=\"gray\">(Prophet's)</span> instructions, \"When you read these instructions, march until you set camp at Nakhlah between Makkah and At-Ta'if. There, watch the movements of the caravan of Quraysh and collect news about them for us.\" When 'Abdullah bin Jahsh read the document, he said, \"I hear and obey.\" He then said to his companions, \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ has commanded me to march forth to Nakhlah to watch the movements of the caravan of Quraysh and to inform him about their news. He has prohibited me from forcing any of you <span class=\"gray\">(to go with me)</span>. So, those who seek martyrdom, they should march with me. Those who dislike the idea of martyrdom, let them turn back. Surely, I will implement the command of Allah's Messenger ﷺ.\" He and his companions continued without any of them turning back.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abdullah entered the Hijaz area <span class=\"gray\">(western Arabia)</span> until he reached an area called Buhran, close to Furu'. There, Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas and 'Utbah bin Ghazwan lost the camel that they were riding in turns, and they went back to search for it while 'Abdullah bin Jahsh and the rest of his companions continued until they reached Nakhlah. Then, a caravan belonging to the Quraysh passed by carrying raisins, food stuff and some trade items for the Quraysh. 'Amr bin Hadrami, whose name was 'Abdullah bin 'Abbad, was in the caravan, as well as 'Uthman bin 'Abdullah bin Al-Mughirah and his brother Nawfal bin 'Abdullah from the tribe of Makhzum, and Al-Hakam bin Kaysan, a freed slave of Hisham bin Al-Mughirah. When they saw the Companions they were frightened, but when they saw 'Ukkashah bin Mihsan their fears subsided, since his head was shaved. They said, \"These people seek the 'Umrah, so there is no need to fear them.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Companions conferred among themselves. That day was the last day in the <span class=\"gray\">(sacred)</span> month of Rajab. They said to each other, \"By Allah! If you let them pass, they will soon enter the Sacred Area and take refuge in it from you. If you kill them, you will kill them during the Sacred Month.\" They at first hesitated and did not like to attack them. They then began encouraging themselves and decided to kill whomever they could among the disbelievers and to confiscate whatever they had. Hence, Waqid bin 'Abdullah At-Tamimi shot an arrow at 'Amr bin Al-Hadrami and killed him. 'Uthman bin 'Abdullah and Al-Hakam bin Kaysan gave themselves up, while Nawfal bin 'Abdullah was able to outrun them in flight. Later on, 'Abdullah bin Jahsh and his companions went back to Allah's Messenger ﷺ in Al-Madinah with the caravan and the two prisoners. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Ishaq went on: I was told that some members of the family of 'Abdullah bin Jahsh said that 'Abdullah said to his companions: \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ will have one-fifth of what we have confiscated.\" This occurred before Allah required one-fifth for His Messenger from the war booty. So, 'Abdullah designated one-fifth of the caravan for Allah's Messenger ﷺ and divided the rest among his companions. Ibn Ishaq also stated that at first, when the Sariyah came back to Allah's Messenger ﷺ, he said to them:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا أَمَرْتُكُمْ بِقِتَالٍ فِي الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I have not commanded you to conduct warfare during the Sacred Month.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He left the caravan and the two prisoners alone and did not take any share of the war booty.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When Allah's Messenger ﷺ did that, the soldiers from the attack were concerned and felt that they were destroyed, and their Muslim brethren criticized them for what they did. The Quraysh said that Muhammad ﷺ and his Companions violated the sanctity of the Sacred Month and shed blood, confiscated property and took prisoners during it. Those who refuted them among the Muslims who remained in Makkah replied that the Muslims had done that during the month of Sha'ban <span class=\"gray\">(which is not a sacred month)</span>. Meanwhile, the Jews were pleased about what happened to Allah's Messenger ﷺ. They said, ' Amr bin Hadrami was killed by Waqid bin 'Abdullah: 'Amr, means the war has started, Hadrami means the war has come, as for Waqid <span class=\"gray\">(bin 'Abdullah)</span>: the war has raged <span class=\"gray\">(using some of the literal meanings of these names to support their fortune-telling!)</span>.\" But, Allah made all that turn against them.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The people continued talking about this matter, then Allah revealed to His Messenger ﷺ:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ وَصَدٌّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَكُفْرٌ بِهِ وَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَإِخْرَاجُ أَهْلِهِ مِنْهُ أَكْبَرُ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَكْبَرُ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months. Say, \"Fighting therein is a great <span class=\"gray\">(transgression)</span> but a greater <span class=\"gray\">(transgression)</span> with Allah is to prevent mankind from following the way of Allah, to disbelieve in Him, to prevent access to Al-Masjid Al-Haram <span class=\"gray\">(at Makkah)</span>, and to drive out its inhabitants, and Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Ayah means, 'If you had killed during the Sacred Month, they <span class=\"gray\">(disbelievers of Quraysh)</span> have hindered you from the path of Allah and disbelieved in it. They also prevented you from entering the Sacred Mosque, and expelled you from it, while you are its people,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَكْبَرُ عِندَ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...a greater <span class=\"gray\">(transgression)</span> with Allah)</span> than killing whom you killed among them. Also:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَكْبَرُ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...and Al-Fitnah is worse than killing.)</span> means, trying to force the Muslims to revert from their religion and re-embrace Kufr after they had believed, is worse with Allah than killing.' Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا يَزَالُونَ يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَن دِينِكُمْ إِنِ اسْتَطَاعُوا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they will never cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion <span class=\"gray\">(Islamic Monotheism)</span> if they can.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So, they will go on fighting you with unrelenting viciousness.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Ishaq went on: When the Qur'an touched this subject and Allah brought relief to the Muslims instead of the sadness that had befallen them, Allah's Messenger ﷺ took possession of the caravan and the two prisoners. The Quraysh offered to ransom the two prisoners, 'Uthman bin 'Abdullah and Hakam bin Kaysan. Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا نَفْدِيكُمُوهُمَا حَتَّى يَقْدَمَ صَاحِبَانَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We will not accept your ransom until our two companions return safely.)</span> meaning Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas and 'Utbah bin Ghazwan, \"For we fear for their safety with you. If you kill them, we will kill your people.\" Later on, Sa'd and 'Utbah returned safely and Allah's Messenger ﷺ accepted the Quraysh's ransom for their prisoners. As for Al-Hakam bin Kaysan, he became Muslim and his Islam strengthened. He remained with Allah's Messenger ﷺ until he was martyred during the incident at Bir Ma'unah <span class=\"gray\">(when the Prophet ﷺ sent seventy Companions to Najd to teach them Islam, but Banu Sulaim killed them all except two)</span>. As for 'Uthman bin 'Abdullah, he went back to Makkah and died there as a disbeliever.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Ishaq went on: When 'Abdullah bin Jahsh and his companions were relieved from their depressing thoughts after the Qur'an was revealed about this subject, they sought the reward of the fighters <span class=\"gray\">(in Allah's way)</span>. They said, \"O Messenger of Allah! We wish that this incident be considered a battle for us, so that we gain the rewards of the Mujahidin.\" Then, Allah revealed:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُوا وَجَاهَدُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ أُولَٰئِكَ يَرْجُونَ رَحْمَتَ اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, those who have believed, and those who have emigrated <span class=\"gray\">(for Allah's religion)</span> and have striven hard in the way of Allah, all these hope for Allah's mercy. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Hence, Allah has greatly elevated their hopes of gaining what they had wished for.</p>"
