And Allah warns you against Himself, and to Allah is the final return <span>(28)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Prohibition of Supporting the Disbelievers</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah prohibited His believing servants from becoming supporters of the disbelievers, or to take them as comrades with whom they develop friendships, rather than the believers. Allah warned against such behavior when He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَيْسَ مِنَ اللَّهِ فِي شَيْءٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whoever does that, will never be helped by Allah in any way)</span> meaning, whoever commits this act that Allah has prohibited, then Allah will discard him. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّخِذُوا عَدُوِّي وَعَدُوَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَاءَ تُلْقُونَ إِلَيْهِم بِالْمَوَدَّةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies as friends, showing affection towards them)</span>, until,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن يَفْعَلْهُ مِنكُمْ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ سَوَاءَ السَّبِيلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whosoever of you does that, then indeed he has gone astray from the straight path.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[60:1]</span>. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّخِذُوا الْكَافِرِينَ أَوْلِيَاءَ مِن دُونِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَتُرِيدُونَ أَن تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ سُلْطَانًا مُّبِينًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe! Take not for friends disbelievers instead of believers. Do you wish to offer Allah a manifest proof against yourselves?)</span><span class=\"gray\">[4:144]</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّخِذُوا الْيَهُودَ وَالنَّصَارَىٰ أَوْلِيَاءَ ۘ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءُ بَعْضٍ وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُم مِّنكُمْ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as friends, they are but friends of each other. And whoever befriends them, then surely, he is one of them.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[5:51]</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah said, after mentioning the fact that the faithful believers gave their support to the faithful believers among the Muhajirin, Ansar and Bedouins,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءُ بَعْضٍ إِلَّا تَفْعَلُوهُ تَكُن فِتْنَةٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَفَسَادٌ كَبِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who disbelieve are allies of one another, <span class=\"gray\">(and)</span> if you do not behave the same, there will be Fitnah and oppression on the earth, and a great mischief and corruption.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[8:73]</span>.</p><p lang=\"el-Latn\" class=\"el-Latn \">Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِلَّا أَن تَتَّقُوا مِنْهُمْ تُقَاةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(unless you indeed fear a danger from them)</span> meaning, except those believers who in some areas or times fear for their safety from the disbelievers. In this case, such believers are allowed to show friendship to the disbelievers outwardly, but never inwardly. For instance, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Ad-Darda' said, \"We smile in the face of some people although our hearts curse them.\" Al-Bukhari said that Al-Hasan said, \"The Tuqyah is allowed until the Day of Resurrection.\" Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ اللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah warns you against Himself.)</span> meaning, He warns you against His anger and the severe torment He prepared for those who give their support to His enemies, and those who have enmity with His friends,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِلَى اللَّهِ الْمَصِيرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And to Allah is the final return)</span> meaning, the return is to Him and He will reward or punish each person according to their deeds.</p>"

And Allah is able to do all things. <span>(29)</span>On the Day when every person will be confronted with the good he has done, and all the evil he has done, he will wish that there were a great distance between him and his evil. And Allah warns you against Himself and Allah is full of kindness with the servants <span>(30)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Allah Knows What the Hearts Conceal</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah tells His servants that He knows the secrets and apparent matters and that nothing concerning them escapes His observation. Rather, His knowledge encompasses them in all conditions, time frames, days and instances. His knowledge encompasses all that is in heaven and earth, and nothing not even the weight of an atom, or what is smaller than that in the earth, seas and mountains, escapes His observation. Indeed,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah is able to do all things.)</span> and His ability encompasses everything. This Ayah alerts Allah's servants that they should fear Him enough to not commit what He prohibits and dislikes, for He has perfect knowledge in all they do and is able to punish them promptly. And He gives respite to some of them, then He punishes them, and He is Swift and Mighty in taking account. This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ تَجِدُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا عَمِلَتْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ مُّحْضَرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day when every person will be confronted with all the good he has done,)</span> meaning, on the Day of Resurrection, Allah brings the good and evil deeds before the servant, just as He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُنَبَّأُ الْإِنسَانُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[75:13]</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When the servant sees his good deeds, he becomes happy and delighted. When he sees the evil deeds he committed, he becomes sad and angry. Then he will wish that he could disown his evil work and that a long distance separated it from him. He will also say to the devil who used to accompany him in this life, and who used to encourage him to do evil;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا لَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts ـ a horrible companion <span class=\"gray\">(indeed)</span>!)</span><span class=\"gray\">[43:38]</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah then said, while threatening and warning,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ اللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah warns you against Himself)</span> meaning, He warns you against His punishment. Allah then said, while bringing hope to His servants, so that they do not despair from His mercy or feel hopeless of His kindness,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">وَاللَّهُ رَءُوفٌ بِالْعِبَادِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah is full of kindness with the servants)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"Allah is so kind with them that He warns them against Himself.\" Others commented, \"He is merciful with His creation and likes for them to remain on His straight path and chosen religion, and to follow His honorable Messenger.\"</p>"

And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. <span>(31)</span>Say: \"Obey Allah and the Messenger.\" But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers <span>(32)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Allah's Love is Attained by Following the Messenger <span class=\"gray\">(ﷺ)</span></h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This honorable Ayah judges against those who claim to love Allah, yet do not follow the way of Muhammad ﷺ. Such people are not true in their claim until they follow the Shari'ah <span class=\"gray\">(Law)</span> of Muhammad ﷺ and his religion in all his statements, actions and conditions. It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلًا لَيْسَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرُنَا فَهُوَ رَدٌّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever commits an act that does not conform with our matter <span class=\"gray\">(religion)</span>, then it will be rejected of him.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is why Allah said here,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ اللَّهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِي يُحْبِبْكُمُ اللَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad ﷺ to mankind)</span>: \"If you <span class=\"gray\">(really)</span> love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you...\")</span> meaning, what you will earn is much more than what you sought in loving Him, for Allah will love you. Al-Hasan Al-Basri and several scholars among the Salaf commented, \"Some people claimed that they love Allah. So Allah tested them with this Ayah;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ اللَّهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِي يُحْبِبْكُمُ اللَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad ﷺ to mankind)</span>: \"If you <span class=\"gray\">(really)</span> love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you...\")</span>. \"</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"And forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\")</span> meaning, by your following the Messenger ﷺ, you will earn all this with the blessing of his mission. Allah next commands everyone,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"Obey Allah and the Messenger.\" But if they turn away)</span> by defying the Prophet ﷺ)</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْكَافِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(then Allah does not like the disbelievers.)</span> thus, testifying that defiance of the Messenger's way constitutes Kufr. Indeed, Allah does not like whoever does this, even if he claims that he loves Allah and seeks a means of approach to Him, unless, and until, he follows the unlettered Prophet, the Final Messenger ﷺ from Allah to the two creations: mankind and the Jinn. This is the Prophet ﷺ who, if the previous Prophets and mighty Messengers were to have been alive during his time, they would have no choice but to follow, obey him, and to abide by his Law. We will mention this fact when we explain the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ النَّبِيِّينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And <span class=\"gray\">(remember)</span> when Allah took the Covenant of the Prophets)</span><span class=\"gray\">[3:81]</span>, Allah willing.</p>"

For instance, Allah chose Adam, created him with His Hand and blew life into him. Allah commanded the angels to prostrate before Adam, taught him the names of everything and allowed him to dwell in Paradise, but then sent him down from it out of His wisdom. Allah chose Nuh and made him the first Messenger to the people of the earth, when the people worshipped idols and associated others with Allah in worship. Allah avenged the way Nuh was treated, for he kept calling his people day and night, in public and in secret, for a very long time. However, his calling them only made them shun him more, and this is when Nuh supplicated against them. So Allah caused them to drown, and none among them was saved, except those who followed the religion that Allah sent to Nuh. Allah also chose the household of Ibrahim, including the master of all mankind, and the Final Prophet, Muhammad, peace be upon him. Allah also chose the household of 'Imran, the father of Marym bint 'Imran, the mother of 'Isa, peace be upon them. So 'Isa is from the offspring of Ibrahim, as we will mention in the Tafsir of Surat Al-An'am, Allah willing, and our trust is in Him.</p>"
