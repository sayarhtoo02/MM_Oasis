This is why Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَمْ يَكُنِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ وَالْمُشْرِكِينَ مُنفَكِّينَ حَتَّىٰ تَأْتِيَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَةُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who disbelieve from among the People of the Scripture and idolators, were not going to leave until there came to them the Bayyinah.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then He explains what the Bayyinah is by His saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَسُولٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ يَتْلُو صُحُفًا مُّطَهَّرَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(A Messenger from Allah, reciting purified pages.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, Muhammad ﷺ and the Magnificent Qur'an he recites, which is written down among the most high gathering in purified pages. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِي صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ - مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ - بِأَيْدِي سَفَرَةٍ - كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In Records held in honor.

After Allah established the proofs and evidences against them, they divided and differed concerning that which Allah had intended in their Scriptures, and they had many differences. This is like what has been reported in a Hadith that has many routes of transmission,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الْيَهُودَ اخْتَلَفُوا عَلَى إِحْدَى وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً، وَإِنَّ النَّصَارَى اخْتَلَفُوا عَلى ثِنْتَيْنِ وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً، وَسَتَفْتَرِقُ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةُ عَلَى ثَلَاثٍ وَسَبْعِينَ فِرْقَةً، كُلُّهَا فِي النَّارِ إِلَّا وَاحِدَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the Jews differed until they became seventy-one sects. And verily, the Christians differed until they became seventy-two sects. And this Ummah will divide into seventy-three sects, and all of them will be in the Fire except one.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">They said, \"Who are they, O Messenger of Allah?\" He ﷺ replied,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا أَنَا عَلَيْهِ وَأَصْحَابِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(Those who are upon)</span> what I and my Companions are upon.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Command of Allah was merely that They make their Religion solely for Him</p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا أُمِرُوا إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, making religion purely for Him alone,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا نُوحِي إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاعْبُدُونِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him: La ilaha illa Ana.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(21:25)</span></p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">Thus, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حُنَفَاءَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Hunafa')</span> meaning, avoiding Shirk and being truly devout to Tawhid. This is like Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger <span class=\"gray\">(proclaiming)</span>: \"Worship Allah, and avoid the Taghut <span class=\"gray\">(false deities)</span>.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(16:36)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">A discussion of the word Hanif has already been mentioned previously and in Surat Al-An'am, so there is no need to repeat it here.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيُقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and perform Salah)</span> And this is the best of the physical forms of worship.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيُؤْتُوا الزَّكَاةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and give Zakah,)</span> This is doing good to the poor and the needy.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَذَٰلِكَ دِينُ الْقَيِّمَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and that is the right religion.)</span> meaning, the upright and just religion, or the nation that is straight and balanced.</p>"

He says that they will be in the fire of Hell on the Day of Judgement and they will abide therein forever. This means that they will remain in it and they will have no way out of it and they will not cease being in it.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُولَٰئِكَ هُمْ شَرُّ الْبَرِيَّةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They are the worst of creatures.)</span> meaning, they are the worst creation that Allah has fashioned and created. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah informs about the situation of the righteous people who believed in their hearts and performed righteous deeds with their bodies. He says that they are the best of creation. Abu Hurayrah and a group of the scholars have used this Ayah as a proof that the believers have a status among the creatures that is better than the angels. This is because Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> أُولَٰئِكَ هُمْ خَيْرُ الْبَرِيَّةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They are the best of creatures.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">جَزَاؤُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Their reward with their Lord)</span> meaning, on the Day of Judgement.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(is Eternal Gardens underneath which rivers flow. They will abide therein forever,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, having no end, no break and no conclusion.</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">رَّضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah will be pleased with them, and they well-pleased with Him.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The condition of Him being pleased with them is more illustrious than all of the everlasting delights that they will be given.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and they well-pleased with Him.)</span> Due to the comprehensive favors He has given them. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِيَ رَبَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That is for him who fears his Lord.)</span> meaning, this is the reward that will be attained by those who revere Allah and fear Him as He deserves to be feared. This is the person who worships Allah as if he sees Him, and he knows that even though he does not see Him, indeed Allah sees him. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَا أُخْبِرُكُمْ بِخَيْرِ الْبَرِيَّةِ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Shall I not inform you of the best of creation?)</span></p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">They said, \"Of course, O Messenger of Allah!\" He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَجُلٌ آخِذٌ بِعِنَانِ فَرَسِهِ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ، كُلَّمَا كَانَتْ هَيْعَةٌ اسْتَوَى عَلَيْهِ. أَلَا أُخْبِرُكُمْ بِخَيْرِ الْبَرِيَّةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(A man who takes the reins of his horse in the way of Allah, and whenever there is a fearful cry from the enemy, he climbs upon it.
