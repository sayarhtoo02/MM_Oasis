    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">His people disputed with him. He said: \"Do you dispute with me about Allah while He has guided me, and I fear not those whom you associate with Allah in worship. <span class=\"gray\">(Nothing can happen to me)</span> except when my Lord wills something. My Lord comprehends in His knowledge all things. Will you not then remember <span>(80)</span>And how should I fear those whom you associate in worship with Allah, while you fear not that you have joined in worship with Allah things for which He has not sent down to you any Sultan. <span class=\"gray\">(So)</span> which of the two parties has more right to be in security? If you but know. <span>(81)</span>It is those who believe and confuse not their belief with Zulm <span class=\"gray\">(wrong)</span>, for them <span class=\"gray\">(only)</span> there is security and they are the guided <span>(82)</span>And that was Our proof which We gave Ibrahim against his people. We in degrees raise whom We will. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing <span>(83)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah states that His Khalil, Prophet Ibrahim, said when his people mentioned various doubts and disputed with him about the Tawhid that he called to:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> أَتُحَاجُّونِّي فِي اللَّهِ وَقَدْ هَدَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do you dispute with me about Allah while He has guided me?)</span>. The Ayah means, do you argue with me about Allah, other than Whom there is no god worthy of worship, while He has guided me to the Truth and made me aware of it? Therefore, how can I ever consider your misguided statements and false doubts? Ibrahim said next,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَلَا أَخَافُ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ بِهِ إِلَّا أَن يَشَاءَ رَبِّي شَيْئًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and I fear not those whom you associate with Allah in worship. <span class=\"gray\">(Nothing can happen to me)</span> except when my Lord wills something.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibrahim said, among the proofs to the falsehood of your creed, is that these false gods that you worship do not bring about any effect, and I do not fear them or care about them. Therefore, if these gods are able to cause harm, then use them against me and do not give me respite. Ibrahim's statement,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">إِلَّا أَن يَشَاءَ رَبِّي شَيْئًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(except when my Lord wills something.)</span> means, only Allah causes benefit or harm.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَسِعَ رَبِّي كُلَّ شَيْءٍ عِلْمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(My Lord comprehends in His knowledge all things.)</span> meaning, Allah's knowledge encompasses all things and nothing escapes His complete observation,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَلَا تَتَذَكَّرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Will you not then remember?)</span> what I explained to you, considering your idols as false gods and refraining from worshipping them? This reasoning from Prophet Ibrahim is similar to the argument that Prophet Hud used against his people, 'Ad. Allah mentioned this incident in His Book, when He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالُوا يَا هُودُ مَا جِئْتَنَا بِبَيِّنَةٍ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِتَارِكِي آلِهَتِنَا عَن قَوْلِكَ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ - إِن نَّقُولُ إِلَّا اعْتَرَاكَ بَعْضُ آلِهَتِنَا بِسُوءٍ قَالَ إِنِّي أُشْهِدُ اللَّهَ وَاشْهَدُوا أَنِّي بَرِيءٌ مِّمَّا تُشْرِكُونَ - مِن دُونِهِ فَكِيدُونِي جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ لَا تُنظِرُونِ - إِنِّي تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللَّهِ رَبِّي وَرَبِّكُم مَّا مِن دَابَّةٍ إِلَّا هُوَ آخِذٌ بِنَاصِيَتِهَا إِنَّ رَبِّي عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They said: \"O Hud! No evidence have you brought us, and we shall not leave our gods for your <span class=\"gray\">(mere)</span> saying! And we are not believers in you. All that we say is that some of our gods have seized you with evil.\" He said: \"I call Allah to witness - and bear you witness - that I am free from that which you ascribe as partners in worship with Him <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span>. So plot against me, all of you, and give me no respite. I put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature but He has grasp of its forelock. Verily, my Lord is on the straight path <span class=\"gray\">(the truth)</span>.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[11:53-56]</span> Ibrahim's statement,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">وَكَيْفَ أَخَافُ مَا أَشْرَكْتُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And how should I fear those whom you associate...)</span> means, how should I fear the idols that you worship instead of Allah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَخَافُونَ أَنَّكُمْ أَشْرَكْتُم بِاللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ عَلَيْكُمْ سُلْطَانًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(while you fear not that you have joined in worship with Allah things for which He has not sent down to you any Sultan.)</span> meaning, proof, according to Ibn 'Abbas and others among the Salaf. Allah said in similar Ayat;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ شَرَعُوا لَهُم مِّنَ الدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَن بِهِ اللَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or have they partners who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not allowed?)</span><span class=\"gray\">[42:21]</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنْ هِيَ إِلَّا أَسْمَاءٌ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَا أَنتُمْ وَآبَاؤُكُم مَّا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَانٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They are but names which you have named, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[53:21]</span> His statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَيُّ الْفَرِيقَيْنِ أَحَقُّ بِالْأَمْنِ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(So)</span> which of the two parties has more right to be in security? If you but know.)</span> means, which of the two parties is on the truth, those who worship Him in Whose Hand is harm and benefit, or those who worship what cannot bring harm or benefit, without authority to justify worshipping them? Who among these two parties has more right to be saved from Allah's torment on the Day of Resurrection? Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَلَمْ يَلْبِسُوا إِيمَانَهُم بِظُلْمٍ أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمُ الْأَمْنُ وَهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is those who believe and confuse not their belief with Zulm <span class=\"gray\">(wrong)</span>, for them <span class=\"gray\">(only)</span> there is security and they are the guided.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, those who worship Allah alone without partners, will acquire safety on the Day of Resurrection, and they are the guided ones in this life and the Hereafter.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Shirk is the Greatest Zulm <span class=\"gray\">(Wrong)</span></h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari recorded that 'Abdullah said, \"When the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَمْ يَلْبِسُوا إِيمَانَهُم بِظُلْمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and confuse not their belief with Zulm <span class=\"gray\">(wrong)</span>.)</span> was revealed, the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ said, 'And who among us did not commit Zulm against himself?' The Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily! Joining others in worship with Allah is a great Zulm <span class=\"gray\">(wrong)</span> indeed.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[31:13]</span>, was later revealed.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that 'Abdullah said, \"When this Ayah was revealed,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَلَمْ يَلْبِسُوا إِيمَانَهُم بِظُلْمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is those who believe and confuse not their belief with Zulm <span class=\"gray\">(wrong)</span>,)</span> it was hard on the people. They said, 'O Allah's Messenger! Who among us did not commit Zulm against himself?' He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ الَّذِي تَعْنُونَ، أَلَمْ تَسْمَعُوا مَا قَالَ الْعَبْدُ الصَّالِحُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is not what you understood from it. Did you not hear what the righteous servant <span class=\"gray\">(Luqman)</span> said,</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا بُنَيَّ لَا تُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O my son! Join not in worship others with Allah. Verily! Shirk is a great Zulm <span class=\"gray\">(wrong)</span> indeed.)</span>) <span class=\"gray\">[31:13]</span>. Therefore, it is about Shirk. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتِلْكَ حُجَّتُنَا آتَيْنَاهَا إِبْرَاهِيمَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And that was Our proof which We gave Ibrahim against his people.)</span> means, We directed him to proclaim Our proof against them. Mujahid and others said that 'Our proof' refers to,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَيْفَ أَخَافُ مَا أَشْرَكْتُمْ وَلَا تَخَافُونَ أَنَّكُمْ أَشْرَكْتُم بِاللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ عَلَيْكُمْ سُلْطَانًا فَأَيُّ الْفَرِيقَيْنِ أَحَقُّ بِالْأَمْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And how should I fear those whom you associate in worship with Allah <span class=\"gray\">(though they can neither benefit nor harm)</span>, while you fear not that you have joined in worship with Allah things for which He has not sent down to you any Sultan. <span class=\"gray\">(So)</span> which of the two parties has more right to be in security?)</span> Allah has testified Ibrahim's statement and affirmed security and guidance, saying;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَلَمْ يَلْبِسُوا إِيمَانَهُم بِظُلْمٍ أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمُ الْأَمْنُ وَهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is those who believe and confuse not their belief with Zulm, for them there is security and they are the guided.)</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتِلْكَ حُجَّتُنَا آتَيْنَاهَا إِبْرَاهِيمَ عَلَىٰ قَوْمِهِ نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَاتٍ مَّن نَّشَاءُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And that was Our proof which We gave Ibrahim against his people. We raise in degrees whom We will.)</span> And;</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.)</span> He is All-Wise in His statements and actions, All-Knower of those whom He guides or misguides, and whether the proof was established against them or not. Allah also said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ - وَلَوْ جَاءَتْهُمْ كُلُّ آيَةٍ حَتَّىٰ يَرَوُا الْعَذَابَ الْأَلِيمَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Truly! Those, against whom the Word <span class=\"gray\">(wrath)</span> of your Lord has been justified, will not believe. Even if every sign should come to them – until they see the painful torment.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[10:96-97]</span> This is why Allah said here,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">إِنَّ رَبَّكَ حَكِيمٌ عَلِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.)</span></p>"
