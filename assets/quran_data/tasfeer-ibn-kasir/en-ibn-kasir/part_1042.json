How can he give importance to that which will soon pass away from him, while ignoring the importance of the abode of eternity and infinity.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ أَحَبَّ دُنْيَاهُ أَضَرَّ بِآخِرَتِهِ، وَمَنْ أَحَبَّ آخِرَتَهُ أَضَرَّ بِدُنْيَاهُ، فَآثِرُوا مَا يَبْقَى عَلَى مَا يَفْنَى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever loves his worldly life, will suffer in his Hereafter, and whoever loves his worldly life, will suffer in his Hereafter, and whoever loves his Hereafter, will suffer in his worldly life.

Imam Malik recorded that Ad-Dahhak bin Qays asked An-Nu'man bin Bashir, \"What else did the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recite on Friday along with Surat Al-Jumu'ah?\" An-Nu'man replied, \"Al-Ghashiyah <span class=\"gray\">(88)</span>.\" This narration has been recorded by Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i, Muslim and Ibn Majah.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ الْغَاشِيَةِ - وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَاشِعَةٌ - عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ - تَصْلَىٰ نَارًا حَامِيَةً - تُسْقَىٰ مِنْ عَيْنٍ آنِيَةٍ - لَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلَّا مِن ضَرِيعٍ - لَّا يُسْمِنُ وَلَا يُغْنِي مِن جُوعٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(1.

Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Burqani narrated from Abu 'Imran Al-Jawni that he said, \" 'Umar bin Al-Khattab passed by the monastery of a monk and he said: 'O monk!' Then the monk came out, and 'Umar looked at him and began to weep. Then it was said to him: 'O Commander of the faithful! Why are you weeping?'
