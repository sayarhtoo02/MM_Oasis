During that era, they did not like the idea of conducting business transactions during the Hajj season. Later, this Ayah was revealed:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُوا فَضْلًا مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord.)</span> during the Hajj season.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abu Dawud and others recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"They used to avoid conducting business transactions during the Hajj season, saying that these are the days of Dhikr. Allah revealed:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُوا فَضْلًا مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord <span class=\"gray\">(during pilgrimage by trading)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is also the explanation of Mujahid, Sa'id bin Jubayr, 'Ikrimah, Mansur bin Al-Mu'tamir, Qatadah, Ibrahim An-Nakha'i, Ar-Rabi' bin Anas and others. Ibn Jarir reported that Abu Umaymah said that when Ibn 'Umar was asked about conducting trade during the Hajj, he recited the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُوا فَضْلًا مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord <span class=\"gray\">(during pilgrimage by trading)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Hadith is related to Ibn 'Umar with a strong chain of narrators. This Hadith is also related to the Prophet ﷺ, as Ahmad reported that Abu Umamah At-Taymi said, \"I asked Ibn 'Umar, 'We buy <span class=\"gray\">(and sell during the Hajj)</span>, so do we still have a valid Hajj?' He said, 'Do you not perform Tawaf around the House, stand at 'Arafat, throw the pebbles and shave your heads?' I said, 'Yes.' Ibn 'Umar said, 'A man came to the Prophet ﷺ and asked him about what you asked me, and the Prophet ﷺ did not answer him until Jibril came down with this Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُوا فَضْلًا مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your Lord <span class=\"gray\">(during pilgrimage by trading)</span>.)</span> The Prophet ﷺ summoned the man and said: <span class=\"gray\">(You are pilgrims)</span>.\" Ibn Jarir narrated that Abu Salih said to 'Umar, \"O Leader of the faithful! Did you conduct trade transactions during the Hajj?\" He said, \"Was their livelihood except during Hajj?\"</p><div lang=\"fil\" class=\"fil \"><h2>Standing at 'Arafat</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِذَا أَفَضْتُم مِّنْ عَرَفَاتٍ فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ عِندَ الْمَشْعَرِ الْحَرَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then when you leave 'Arafat, remember Allah <span class=\"gray\">(by glorifying His praises, i.e., prayers and invocations)</span> at the Mash'ar-il-Haram.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Arafat is the place where one stands during the Hajj and it is a pillar of the rituals of Hajj. Imam Ahmad and the Sunan compilers recorded that 'Abdur-Rahman bin Ya'mar Ad-Diyli said that he heard Allah's Messenger ﷺ saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْحَجُّ عَرَفَاتٌ - ثَلَاثًا - فَمَنْ أَدْرَكَ عَرَفَةَ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَطْلُعَ الْفَجْرُ فَقَدْ أَدْرَكَ، وَأَيَّامُ مِنًى ثَلَاثَــةٌ، فَمَنْ تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ فَلَا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ، وَمَنْ تَأَخَّرَ فَلَا إِثْمَ عَلَيهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Hajj is 'Arafat, <span class=\"gray\">(thrice)</span>. Hence, those who have stood at 'Arafat before dawn will have performed <span class=\"gray\">(the rituals of the Hajj)</span>. The days of Mina are three, and there is no sin for those who move on after two days, or for those who stay.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The time to stand on 'Arafat starts from noon on the day of 'Arafah until dawn the next day, which is the day of the Sacrifice <span class=\"gray\">(the tenth day of Dhul-Hijjah)</span>. The Prophet ﷺ stood at 'Arafat during the Farewell Hajj, after he had offered the Zuhr <span class=\"gray\">(noon)</span> prayer, until sunset. He said, \"Learn your rituals from me.\" In this Hadith <span class=\"gray\">(i. e., in the previous paragraph)</span> he said, \"Whoever stood at 'Arafat before dawn, will have performed <span class=\"gray\">(the rituals of Hajj)</span>.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Urwah bin Mudarris bin Harithah bin Lam At-Ta'i said, \"I came to Allah's Messenger ﷺ at Al-Muzdalifah when it was time to pray. I said, 'O Messenger of Allah! I came from the two mountains of Tayy', and my animal became tired and I became tired. I have not left any mountain, but stood on it. Do I have a valid Hajj?' Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ شَهِدَ صَلَاتَنَا هذِهِ، فَوَقَفَ مَعَنَا حَتَّى نَدْفَعَ، وَقَدْ وَقَفَ بِعَرَفَةَ قَبْلَ ذلِكَ لَيْلًا أَوْ نَهارًا فَقَدْ تَمَّ حَجُّهُ وَقَضَى تَفَثَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever performed this prayer with us, stood with us until we moved forth, and had stood at 'Arafat before that, day or night, will have performed the Hajj and completed its rituals)</span>.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Hadith was collected by Imam Ahmad and the compilers of the Sunan, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Sahih. It was reported that the mount was called 'Arafat because, as 'Abdur-Razzaq reported that 'Ali bin Abu Talib said, \"Allah sent Jibril to Prophet Ibrahim and he performed Hajj for him <span class=\"gray\">(to teach him its rituals)</span>. When Ibrahim reached 'Arafat he said, 'I have 'Araftu <span class=\"gray\">(I know this place)</span>.' He had come to that area before. Thereafter, it was called 'Arafat.\" Ibn Al-Mubarak said that 'Ata' said, \"It was called 'Arafat because Jibril used to teach Ibrahim the rituals of Hajj. Ibrahim would say, 'I have 'Araftu, I have 'Araftu.' It was thereafter called 'Arafat.\" Similar statements were attributed to Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn 'Umar and Abu Mijlaz. Allah knows best.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Arafat is also called Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram, Al-Mash'ar Al-Aqsa and Ilal, while the mount that is in the middle of 'Arafat is called Jabal Ar-Rahmah <span class=\"gray\">(Mount of Mercy)</span>.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Time to leave 'Arafat and Al-Muzdalifah</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abu Hatim reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"During the time of Jahiliyyah, the people used to stand at 'Arafat. When the sun would be on top of the mountains, just as the turban is on top of a man's head, they would move on. Allah's Messenger ﷺ delayed moving from 'Arafat until sunset.\" Ibn Marduwyah related this Hadith and added, \"He then stood at Al-Muzdalifah and offered the Fajr <span class=\"gray\">(Dawn)</span> prayer at an early time. When the light of dawn broke, he moved on.\" This Hadith has a Hasan chain of narrators. The long Hadith that Jabir bin 'Abdullah narrated, which Muslim collected, stated, \"The Prophet ﷺ kept standing there <span class=\"gray\">(meaning at 'Arafat)</span> until sunset, when the yellow light had somewhat gone and the disc of the sun had disappeared. Then, the Prophet ﷺ made Usamah sit behind him, and in order to keep her under control, pulled the nose string of Al-Qaswa' so hard, that its head touched the saddle. He gestured with his right hand and said, \"Proceed calmly people, calmly!\" Whenever he happened to pass over an elevated tract of sand, he lightly loosened the nose string of his camel till she climbed up and this is how they reached Al-Muzdalifah. There, he led the Maghrib <span class=\"gray\">(Evening)</span> and 'Isha' <span class=\"gray\">(Night)</span> prayers with one Adhan and two Iqamah <span class=\"gray\">(which announces the imminent start of the acts of the prayer)</span> and did not glorify Allah in between them <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., he did not perform voluntary Rak'ah)</span>. Allah's Messenger ﷺ then laid down till dawn and offered the Fajr <span class=\"gray\">(Dawn)</span> prayer with Adhan and Iqamah, when the morning light was clear. He again mounted Al-Qaswa', and when he came to Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram, he faced towards Qiblah, supplicated to Allah, glorifying Him and saying, La ilaha illallah, and he continued standing until the daylight was very clear. He then went quickly before the sun rose.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Usamah bin Zayd was asked, \"How was the Prophet's pace when he moved?\" He said, \"Slow, unless he found space, then he would go a little faster.\"</p><div lang=\"hi-Latn\" class=\"hi-Latn \"><h2>Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram</h2></div><p lang=\"hmn\" class=\"hmn \">Abdur-Razzaq reported that Ibn 'Umar said that all of Al-Muzdalifah is Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram. It was reported that Ibn 'Umar was asked about Allah's statement:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ عِندَ الْمَشْعَرِ الْحَرَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...remember Allah <span class=\"gray\">(by glorifying His praises, i.e., prayers and invocations)</span> at the Mash'ar-il-Haram.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He said, \"It is the Mount and the surrounding area.\" It was reported that Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram is what is between the two Mounts <span class=\"gray\">(refer to the following Hadith)</span>, as Ibn 'Abbas, Sa'id bin Jubayr, 'Ikrimah, Mujahid, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi' bin Anas, Al-Hasan and Qatadah have stated.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Mut'im narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُّ عَرَفَاتٍ مَوْقِفٌ، وَارْفَعُوا عَنْ عُرَنَةَ، وَكُلُّ مُزْدَلِفَةَ مَوْقِفٌ، وَارْفَعُوا عَنْ مُحَسِّرٍ، وَكُلُّ فِجَاجِ مَكَّةَ مَنْحَرٌ، وَكُلُّ أَيَّامِ التَّشْرِيقِ ذَبْحٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(All of 'Arafat is a place of standing, and keep away from 'Uranah. All of Al-Muzdalifah is a place for standing, and keep away from the bottom of Muhassir. All of the areas of Makkah are a place for sacrifice, and all of the days of Tashriq are days of sacrifice.)</span></p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah then said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاذْكُرُوهُ كَمَا هَدَاكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And remember Him <span class=\"gray\">(by invoking Allah for all good)</span> as He has guided you.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Ayah reminds Muslims of Allah's bounty on them that He has directed and taught them the rituals of Hajj according to the guidance of Prophet Ibrahim Al-Khalil. This is why Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِن كُنتُم مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَمِنَ الضَّالِّينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...and verily, you were, before, of those who were astray.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was said that this Ayah refers to the condition before the guidance or the Qur'an or the Messenger ﷺ, all of which are correct meanings.</p>"
