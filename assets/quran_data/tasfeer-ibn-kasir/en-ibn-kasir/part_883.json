    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">O you who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. And whosoever does that, then they are the losers <span>(9)</span>And spend of that with which We have provided you before death comes to one of you, and he says: \"My Lord! If only You would give me respite for a little while, then I should give Sadaqah from my wealth, and be among the righteous <span>(10)</span>And Allah grants respite to none when his appointed time comes. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do <span>(11)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Importance of not being too concerned with the Matters of the Worldly Life, and being Charitable before Death</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah the Exalted orders His faithful servants to remember Him frequently and to refrain from being distracted from His remembrance by indulging in their properties and children excessively. Allah informs them that those who engage in this life, its delights and attributes and were busied from the obedience and remembrance of Allah, for which they were created, will be among the losers. They will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Allah encourages the believers to spend in His cause,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنْفِقُوا مِنْ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ فَيَقُولَ رَبِّ لَوْلَا أَخَّرْتَنِي إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ فَأَصَّدَّقَ وَأَكُنْ مِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And spend of that with which We have provided you before death comes to one of you, and he says: \"My Lord! If only You would give me respite for a little while, then I should give Sadaqah from my wealth, and be among the righteous.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Surely, every person who fell into shortcomings will regret it by the time of his death and will ask for respite, even a short period, so that he does better and attains what he missed. No, rather what occurred, has occurred and what is coming, shall indeed come. Each will be held accountable for his mistakes. As for the disbelievers, they will be as Allah said about them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنْذِرِ النَّاسَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمُ الْعَذَابُ فَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا رَبَّنَا أَخِّرْنَا إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ قَرِيبٍ نُجِبْ دَعْوَتَكَ وَنَتَّبِعِ الرُّسُلَ ۗ أَوَلَمْ تَكُونُوا أَقْسَمْتُمْ مِنْ قَبْلُ مَا لَكُمْ مِنْ زَوَالٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And warn mankind of the Day when the torment will come unto them; then the wrongdoers will say:\"Our Lord! Respite us for a little while, we will answer Your call and follow the Messengers!\" <span class=\"gray\">(It will be said)</span>: \"Had you not sworn aforetime that you would not leave.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(14:44)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءَ أَحَدَهُمُ الْمَوْتُ قَالَ رَبِّ ارْجِعُونِ - لَعَلِّي أَعْمَلُ صَالِحًا فِيمَا تَرَكْتُ ۚ كَلَّا ۚ إِنَّهَا كَلِمَةٌ هُوَ قَائِلُهَا ۖ وَمِنْ وَرَائِهِمْ بَرْزَخٌ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Until, when death comes to one of them, he says: \"My Lord! send me back. So that I may do good in that which I have left behind!\" No! It is but a word that he speaks; and behind them is Barzakh <span class=\"gray\">(a barrier)</span> until the Day when they will be resurrected.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(23:99-100)</span> Then Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَنْ يُؤَخِّرَ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِذَا جَاءَ أَجَلُهَا ۚ وَاللَّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah grants respite to none when his appointed time comes. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.)</span> meaning, when the time of death comes, no one will be granted respite. Surely, HSe is the Most Knowledgeable and t an what they did before. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Munafiqun. All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and all success and immunity from error come from Him.</p>"

And Allah is the All-Knower of what is in the breasts.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Praising Allah and mentioning His Creation and Knowledge</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the last Surah among Al-Musabbihat. We mentioned before that all creatures praise the glory of Allah, their Creator and Owner. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(His is the dominion, and to Him belongs the praise,)</span> meaning, He is the One Who has control over all creation, the One praised for all He created and decreed. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and He is Able to do all things.)</span> means that whatever He wills occurs without resistance, and whatever He does not will, never occurs. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ فَمِنْكُمْ كَافِرٌ وَمِنْكُمْ مُؤْمِنٌ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He it is Who created you, then some of you are disbelievers and some of you are believers.)</span> meaning, Allah created you with these characteristics and He willed that for you. Therefore, there will be believers and disbelievers. Surely, Allah is the One Who sees those who deserve guidance and those who deserve misguidance. He is the Witness over His servant's deeds and He will completely recompense them. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah is All-Seer of what you do.)</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِالْحَقِّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He has created the heavens and the earth with truth,)</span> with equity and wisdom,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَصَوَّرَكُمْ فَأَحْسَنَ صُوَرَكُمْ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and He shaped you and made good your shapes.)</span> He made you in the best shapes and forms. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الْإِنْسَانُ مَا غَرَّكَ بِرَبِّكَ الْكَرِيمِ - الَّذِي خَلَقَكَ فَسَوَّاكَ فَعَدَلَكَ - فِي أَيِّ صُورَةٍ مَا شَاءَ رَكَّبَكَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O man! What has made you careless about your Lord, the most Generous? Who created you, fashioned you perfectly and gave you due proportion; in whatever form He willed, He put you together.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(82:6-8)</span> And His saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللَّهُ الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ قَرَارًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَصَوَّرَكُمْ فَأَحْسَنَ صُوَرَكُمْ وَرَزَقَكُمْ مِنَ الطَّيِّبَاتِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah, it is He Who has made for you the earth as a dwelling place and the sky as a canopy, and has given you shape and made your shapes good <span class=\"gray\">(looking)</span> and has provided you with good things.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(40:64)</span> and His saying;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِلَيْهِ الْمَصِيرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And to Him is the return.)</span> means the return and final destination. Allah then informs of His knowledge of all that there is in the heavens, in the earth and in the souls, He said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُسِرُّونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ ۚ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He knows what is in the heavens and on earth, and He knows what you conceal and what you reveal.
