    "text": "<p class=\"en translation\" lang=\"en\">Verily, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger, Allah has cursed them in this world and in the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating torment <span>(57)</span>And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly, they bear the crime of slander and plain sin <span>(58)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Whoever annoys Allah and His Messenger  صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم , is cursed in this World and the Hereafter </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Here, Allah warns and threatens those who annoy Him by going against His commands and doing that which He has forbidden, and who persist in doing so, and those who annoy His Messenger ﷺ by accusing him of having faults or shortcomings – Allah forbid. 'Ikrimah said that the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger,)</span> was revealed concerning those who make pictures or images. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In The Two Sahihs, it is reported that Abu Hurayrah said: \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: يُؤْذِينِي ابْنُ آدَمَ، يَسُبُّ الدَّهْرَ وَأَنَا الدَّهْرُ أُقَلِّبُ لَيْلَهُ وَنَهَارَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah says: \"The son of Adam annoys Me by inveighing against time, but I am time, for I cause the alternation of night and day.\")</span>\" The meaning of this Hadith is that in the Jahiliyyah they used to say, \"How bad time is, it has done such and such to us!\" They used to attribute the deeds of Allah to time, and inveigh against it, but the One Who did that was Allah, may He be exalted. So, He forbade them from this. Al-'Awfi reported that Ibn 'Abbas said that the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger,)</span> was revealed about those who slandered the Prophet ﷺ over his marriage to Safiyyah bint Huyay bin Akhtab. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Ayah appears to be general in meaning and to apply to all those who annoy him in any way, because whoever annoys him annoys Allah, just as whoever obeys him obeys Allah.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Threat to Those Who fabricate Slander</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ بِغَيْرِ مَا اكْتَسَبُوا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly,)</span> means, they attribute to them things of which they are innocent, which they do not know and do not do.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَقَدِ احْتَمَلُوا بُهْتَانًا وَإِثْمًا مُبِينًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(they bear the crime of slander and plain sin.)</span> This is the most serious slander, to tell or transmit things about the believing men and women that they have not done, in order to bring shame upon them and accuse them of shortcomings. Among those to whom the description most applies are those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers, followed by the Rafidites who accuse the Companions of shortcomings and faults of which Allah has stated that they are innocent, and describe them as the opposite of what Allah has said about them. Allah, may He be exalted, has told us that He is pleased with the Migrants and Ansar, and has praised them, but these foolish and ignorant people inveigh against them and accuse them of shortcomings, and say things about them that they did not do and could never have done. In reality, their hearts are misguided, for they condemn those who deserve praise and praise those who deserve condemnation. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abu Dawud recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that it was said: \"O Messenger of Allah, what is backbiting <span class=\"gray\">(Ghibah)</span>?\" He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذِكْرُكَ أَخَاكَ بِمَا يَكْرَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is when you mention something about your brother that he dislikes.)</span> It was asked, \"But what if what I say about my brother is true?\" He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنْ كَانَ فِيهِ مَا تَقُولُ فَقَدِ اغْتَبْتَهُ، وَإِنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ فِيهِ مَا تَقُولُ فَقَدْ بَهَتَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If it is true, then you have committed backbiting <span class=\"gray\">(Ghibah)</span> about him, and if it is not true, then you have slandered him.)</span> This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who said, \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p>"

The Jilbab is a Rida', worn over the Khimar. This was the view of Ibn Mas'ud, 'Ubaydah, Qatadah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Sa'id bin Jubayr, Ibrahim An-Nakha'i, 'Ata' Al-Khurasani and others. It is like the Izar used today. Al-Jawhari said: \"The Jilbab is the outer wrapper.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas said that Allah commanded the believing women, when they went out of their houses for some need, to cover their faces from above their heads with the Jilbab, leaving only one eye showing. Muhammad bin Sirin said, \"I asked 'Ubaydah As-Salmani about the Ayah:</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِنْ جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(to draw their Jalabib over their bodies.)</span> He covered his face and head, with just his left eye showing.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَنْ يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That will be better that they should be known so as not to be annoyed.)</span> means, if they do that, it will be known that they are free, and that they are not servants or whores.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَحِيمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)</span> means, with regard to what happened previously during the days of Jahiliyyah, when they did not have any knowledge about this.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">A Stern Warning to the Evil Hypocrites</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah issues a warning to the hypocrites, those who make an outward display of faith while concealing their disbelief,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ مَرَضٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(those in whose hearts is a disease,)</span> 'Ikrimah and others said that this refers to adulterers in this instance.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْمُرْجِفُونَ فِي الْمَدِينَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and those who spread false news among the people in Al-Madinah)</span> means, those who say that the enemy has come and war has started, which is a lie and a fabrication.
