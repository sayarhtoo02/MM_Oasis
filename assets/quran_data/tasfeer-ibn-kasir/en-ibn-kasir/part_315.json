    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So, the sorcerers were assembled at a fixed time on a day appointed <span>(38)</span>And it was said to the people: \"Are you <span class=\"gray\">(too)</span> going to assemble? <span>(39)</span>\"That we may follow the sorcerers if they are the winners. <span>(40)</span>So, when the sorcerers arrived, they said to Fir'awn: \"Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners? <span>(41)</span>He said: \"Yes, and you shall then verily be of those brought near <span class=\"gray\">(to myself)</span>. <span>(42)</span>Musa said to them: \"Throw what you are going to throw! <span>(43)</span>So, they threw their ropes and their sticks, and said: \"By the might of Fir'awn, it is we who will certainly win! <span>(44)</span>Then Musa threw his stick, and behold, it swallowed up all that they falsely showed <span>(45)</span>And the sorcerers fell down prostrate <span>(46)</span>Saying: \"We believe in the Lord of Al-'Alamin. <span>(47)</span>\"The Lord of Musa and Harun. <span>(48)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Between Musa, peace be upon him, and the Sorcerers </h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah describes the actual encounter between Musa,Peace be upon Him,and the Egyptions in Surat Al-A' raf, Surah Ta Ha, and in this Surah. The Egyptians wanted to extinguish the Light of Allah with their words, but Allah insisted that His Light should prevail even though the disbelievers disliked that. This is the issue of disbelief and faith; they never confront one another but faith always prevails:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَلْ نَقْذِفُ بِالْحَقِّ عَلَى الْبَاطِلِ فَيَدْمَغُهُ فَإِذَا هُوَ زَاهِقٌ ۚ وَلَكُمُ الْوَيْلُ مِمَّا تَصِفُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Nay, We fling the truth against the falsehood, so it destroys it, and behold, it disappears. And woe to you for that which you ascribe.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(21:18)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقُلْ جَاءَ الْحَقُّ وَزَهَقَ الْبَاطِلُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And say: \"Truth has come and falsehood has vanished.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:81)</span> The sorcerers of Egypt were the most skilled in the art of illusion, but when a huge group of them gathered from all corners of the land, and the people came together on that day whose exact numbers are known to Allah Alone, one of them said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَعَلَّنَا نَتَّبِعُ السَّحَرَةَ إِن كَانُوا هُمُ الْغَالِبِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That we may follow the sorcerers if they are the winners.)</span> They did not say: 'we will follow the truth, whether it rests with the sorcerers or with Musa;' the people were followers of the religion of their king.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَمَّا جَاءَ السَّحَرَةُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So, when the sorcerers arrived,)</span> means, when they reached the court of Fir'awn, and a pavilion had been erected for him. There he gathered his servants, followers, administrators, and provincial leaders, and the soldiers of his kingdom. The sorcerers stood before Fir'awn, asking him to treat them well and bring them closer to him if they prevailed in this matter which he had brought them together for. They said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَئِنَّ لَنَا لَأَجْرًا إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ الْغَالِبِينَ - قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ إِذًا لَّمِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners?\" He said: \"Yes, and you shall then verily be of those brought near.\")</span> meaning, 'and you will be given more than what you are asking for; I will make you among those who are close to me, those who sit with me.' So they went back to their places:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالُوا يَا مُوسَىٰ إِمَّا أَن تُلْقِيَ وَإِمَّا أَن نَّكُونَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ أَلْقَىٰ - قَالَ بَلْ أَلْقُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They said: \"O Musa! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw?\" <span class=\"gray\">(Musa)</span> said: \"Nay, throw you <span class=\"gray\">(first)</span>!\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(20:65-66)</span>. Here the incident is described more briefly. Musa said to them:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلْقُوا مَا أَنتُم مُّلْقُونَ - فَأَلْقَوْا حِبَالَهُمْ وَعِصِيَّهُمْ وَقَالُوا بِعِزَّةِ فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الْغَالِبُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Throw what you are going to throw!\" So, they threw their ropes and their sticks, and said: \"By the might of Fir'awn, it is we who will certainly win!\")</span> This is what the ignorant masses say when they do something: 'this is by the virtue of So-and-so!' In Surat Al-A'raf Allah mentioned that they:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَحَرُوا أَعْيُنَ النَّاسِ وَاسْتَرْهَبُوهُمْ وَجَاءُوا بِسِحْرٍ عَظِيمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them, and they displayed a great magic)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7:116)</span>. And in Surah Ta Ha He said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِذَا حِبَالُهُمْ وَعِصِيُّهُمْ يُخَيَّلُ إِلَيْهِ مِن سِحْرِهِمْ أَنَّهَا تَسْعَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(20:66)</span> until Allah saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا يُفْلِحُ السَّاحِرُ حَيْثُ أَتَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and the magician will never be successful, whatever the amount <span class=\"gray\">(of skill)</span> he may attain)</span><span class=\"gray\">(20:69)</span>. And here Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَلْقَىٰ مُوسَىٰ عَصَاهُ فَإِذَا هِيَ تَلْقَفُ مَا يَأْفِكُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then Musa threw his stick, and behold, it swallowed up all that they falsely showed!)</span> by snatching up and catching them from every corner and swallowing them up, and it did not leave any of them untouched. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَوَقَعَ الْحَقُّ وَبَطَلَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect.)</span> until</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">رَبِّ مُوسَىٰ وَهَارُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Lord of Musa and Harun.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7:118-122)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This was a very serious matter, furnishing decisive proof leaving no room for any excuse. Fir'awn's supporters, who sought and hoped that they would prevail over Musa, were themselves defeated. At that moment they believed in Musa and prostrated to Allah, the Lord of Al-'Alamin Who sent Musa and Harun with the truth and an obvious miracle.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Fir'awn was defeated in a manner the likes of which the world had never seen, but he remained arrogant and stubborn despite the clear evidence, may the curse of Allah and the angels and all of mankind be upon him. He resorted to arrogance and stubbornness and propagating falsehood. He began to issue threats against them, saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ الَّذِي عَلَّمَكُمُ السِّحْرَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, he is your chief who has taught you magic)</span><span class=\"gray\">(20:71)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَمَكْرٌ مَّكَرْتُمُوهُ فِي الْمَدِينَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7:123)</span>.</p>"

Then Fir'awn said to them:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">آمَنتُمْ لَهُ قَبْلَ أَنْ آذَنَ لَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(You have believed in him before I give you leave.)</span> meaning, 'you should have asked my permission for what you did, and you did not consult with me; if I had given you permission you could have done it, and if I did not allow you, you should not have done it, for I am the ruler and the one to be obeyed.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّهُ لَكَبِيرُكُمُ الَّذِي عَلَّمَكُمُ السِّحْرَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely, he indeed is your chief, who has taught you magic!)</span> This is stubborn talk, and anyone can see that it is nonsense, for they had never met Musa before that day, so how could he have been their chief who taught them how to do magic No rational person would say this. Then Fir'awn threatened to cut off their hands and feet, and crucify them. They said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا ضَيْرَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(No harm!)</span> meaning, 'no problem, that will not harm us and we do not care.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّا إِلَىٰ رَبِّنَا مُنقَلِبُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely, to our Lord we are to return.)</span> means, 'the return of us all is to Allah, may He be glorified, and He will never allow the reward of anyone who has done good to be lost. What you have done to us is not hidden from Him, and He will reward us in full for that.' So they said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّا نَطْمَعُ أَن يَغْفِرَ لَنَا رَبُّنَا خَطَايَانَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, we really hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins,)</span> 'the sins we have committed and the magic you forced us to do.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَن كُنَّا أَوَّلَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(as we are the first of the believers,)</span> means, because we are the first of our people, the Egyptians, to believe. So he killed them all.</p>"
