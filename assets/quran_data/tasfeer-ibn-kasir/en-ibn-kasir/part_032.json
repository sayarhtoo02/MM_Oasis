    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Reason for the Revelation of this Surah and its Virtues</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded from Ubayy bin Ka'b that the idolators said to the Prophet ﷺ, \"O Muhammad! Tell us the lineage of your Lord.\" So Allah revealed</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ - اللَّهُ الصَّمَدُ - لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ - وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(1. Say: \"He is Allah\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(2. \"One\".)</span><span class=\"gray\">(3. \"He begets not, nor was He begotten\".)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4. \"And there is non comparable to Him.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Similar was recorded by At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Jarir and they added in their narration that he said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الصَّمَدُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(As-Samad)</span> is One Who does not give birth, nor was He born, because there is nothing that is born except that it will die, and there is nothing that dies except that it leaves behind inheritance, and indeed Allah does not die and He does not leave behind any inheritance.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And there is none comparable to Him.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This means that there is none similar to Him, none equal to Him and there is nothing at all like Him.\"</p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded it and At-Tirmidhi mentioned it as a Mursal narration. Then At-Tirmidhi said, \"And this is the most correct.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">A Hadith on its Virtues</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari reported from 'Amrah bint 'Abdur-Rahman, who used to stay in the apartment of 'A'ishah, the wife of the Prophet ﷺ, that 'A'ishah said, \"The Prophet ﷺ sent a man as the commander of a war expedition and he used to lead his companions in prayer with recitation <span class=\"gray\">(of the Qur'an)</span>. And he would complete his recitation with the recitation of 'Say: He is Allah, One.' So when they returned they mentioned that to the Prophet ﷺ and he said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَلُوهُ لِأَيِّ شَيْءٍ يَصْنَعُ ذَلِكَ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Ask him why does he do that.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So they asked him and he said, 'Because it is the description of Ar-Rahman and I love to recite it. So the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَخْبِرُوهُ أَنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى يُحِبُّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Inform him that Allah the Most High loves him.)</span>\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is how Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith in his Book of Tawhid. Muslim and An-Nasa'i also recorded it.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In his Book of Salah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas said, \"A man from the Ansar used to lead the people in prayer in the Masjid of Quba'. Whenever he began a Surah in the recitation of the prayer that he was leading them, he would start by reciting 'Say: He is Allah, One' until he completed the entire Surah. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then he would recite another Surah along with it <span class=\"gray\">(after it)</span>. And used to do this in every Rak'ah. So his companions spoke to him about this saying; 'Verily, you begin the prayer with this Surah. Then you think that it is not sufficient for you unless you recite another Surah as well. So you should either recite it or leave it and recite another Surah instead.'</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The man replied, 'I will not leave it off. If you want me to continue leading you <span class=\"gray\">(in prayer)</span>, I will do this; and if you all do not like it, I will leave you <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., I will stop leading you)</span>.' They used to consider him to be of the best of them to lead them in prayer and they did not want anyone else to lead them other than him. So, when the Prophet ﷺ came they informed him of this information and he said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا فُلَانُ، مَا يَمْنَعُكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ مَا يَأْمُرُكَ بِهِ أَصْحَابُكَ، وَمَا حَمَلَكَ عَلَى لُزُومِ هَذِهِ السُّورَةِ فِي كُلِّ رَكْعَةٍ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O so-and-so! What prevents you from doing what your companions are commanding you to do, and what makes you adhere to the recitation of this Surah in every Rak'ah?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The man said, 'Verily, I love it.' The Prophet ﷺ replied,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حُبُّكَ إِيَّاهَا أَدْخَلَكَ الْجَنَّةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Your love of it will cause you to enter Paradise.)</span> This was recorded by Al-Bukhari, with a disconnected chain, but in a manner indicating his approval.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">A Hadith that mentions this Surah is equivalent to a Third of the Qur'an</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Sa'id that a man heard another man reciting</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"He is Allah, One.\")</span> and he was repeating over and over. So when morning came, the man went to the Prophet ﷺ and mentioned that to him, and it was as though he was belittling it. The Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ إِنَّهَا لَتَعْدِلُ ثُلُثَ الْقُرْآنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By He in Whose Hand is my soul, verily it is equivalent to a third of the Qur'an.)</span> Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i also recorded it. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Another Hadith</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Sa'id, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to his Companions,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَيَعْجِزُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَنْ يَقْرَأَ ثُلُثَ الْقُرْآنِ فِي لَيْلَةٍ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Is one of you not able to recite a third of the Qur'an in a single night?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This was something that was difficult for them and they said, \"Which of us is able to do that, O Messenger of Allah?\" So he ﷺ replied,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللهُ الْوَاحِدُ الصَّمَدُ ثُلُثُ الْقُرْآنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Allah is the One, As-Samad\" is a third of the Qur'an.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari was alone in recording this Hadith.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Another Hadith that its Recitation Necessitates Admission into Paradise</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Malik bin Anas recorded from 'Ubayd bin Hunayn that he heard Abu Hurayrah saying, \"I went out with the Prophet ﷺ and he heard a man reciting 'Say: He is Allah, the One.' So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَبَت</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is obligatory.)</span> I asked, 'What is obligatory?' He replied,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْجَنَّةُ</p><p lang=\"zu\" class=\"zu \"><span class=\"gray\">(Paradise.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded it by way of Malik, and At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih Gharib. We do not know of it except as a narration of Malik.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Hadith in which the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حُبُّكَ إِيَّاهَا أَدْخَلَكَ الْجَنَّةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Your love of it will cause you to enter Paradise.)</span> has already been mentioned.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">A Hadith about repeating this Surah</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abdullah bin Imam Ahmad recorded from Mu'adh bin 'Abdullah bin Khubayb, who reported that his father said, \"We became thirsty and it had become dark while we were waiting for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to lead us in prayer. Then, when he came out he took me by my hand and said,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">قُلْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say.)</span> Then he was silent. Then he said again,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">قُلْ</p><p lang=\"mi\" class=\"mi \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say.)</span> So I said, 'What should I say?' He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْمُعَوِّذَتَيْنِ حِينَ تُمْسِي وَحِينَ تُصْبِحُ ثَلَاثًا، تَكْفِكَ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ مَرَّتَيْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"He is Allah, One,\" and the two Surahs of Refuge <span class=\"gray\">(Al-Falaq and An-Nas)</span> when you enter upon the evening and the morning three times <span class=\"gray\">(each)</span>. They will be sufficient for you two times every day.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">This Hadith was also recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih Gharib.\" An-Nasa'i also recorded through another chain of narrators with the wording,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَكْفِكَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They will suffice you against everything.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Another Hadith about supplicating with it by Allah's Names</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In his Book of Tafsir, An-Nasa'i recorded from 'Abdullah bin Buraydah, who reported from his father that he entered the Masjid with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and there was a man praying and supplicating saying, \"O Allah! Verily, I ask you by my testifying that there is no God worthy of worship except You. You are the One, the Self-Sufficient Sustainer of all, Who does not give birth, nor were You born, and there is none comparable to Him.\" The Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَقَدْ سَأَلَهُ بِاسْمِهِ الْأَعْظَمِ، الَّذِي إِذَا سُئِلَ بِهِ أَعطَى، وإِذَا دُعِيَ بِهِ أَجَابَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By He in Whose Hand is my soul, verily he has asked Him by His Greatest Name. It is His Name that if He is asked by it, He will give, and if He is called upon by it, He will answer.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The other Sunan compilers have also recorded this Hadith. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Gharib.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">A Hadith about seeking a Cure by these Surahs</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari recorded from 'A'ishah that whenever the Prophet ﷺ would go to bed every night, he would put his palms together and blow into them. Then he would recite into them <span class=\"gray\">(his palms)</span>, 'Say: He is Allah, One', 'Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of Al-Falaq', and 'Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind.' Then he would wipe whatever he was able to of his body with them <span class=\"gray\">(his palms)</span>. He would begin wiping his head and face with them and the front part of his body. He would do this <span class=\"gray\">(wiping his body)</span> three times. The Sunan compilers also recorded this same Hadith.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ - اللَّهُ الصَّمَدُ - لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ - وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(1. Say: \"He is Allah, One.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(2. \"Allah As-Samad.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(3. \"He begets not, nor was He begotten.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(4. \"And there is none comparable to Him.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The reason for the revelation of this Surah has already been mentioned. 'Ikrimah said, \"When the Jews said, 'We worship 'Uzayr, the son of Allah,' and the Christians said, 'We worship the Messiah <span class=\"gray\">('Isa)</span>, the son of Allah,' and the Zoroastrians said, 'We worship the sun and the moon,' and the idolators said, 'We worship idols,' Allah revealed to His Messenger ﷺ,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"He is Allah, One.\")</span> meaning, He is the One, the Singular, Who has no peer, no assistant, no rival, no equal and none comparable to Him. This word <span class=\"gray\">(Al-Ahad)</span> cannot be used for anyone in affirmation except Allah the Mighty and Majestic, because He is perfect in all of His attributes and actions. Concerning His saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللَّهُ الصَّمَدُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah As-Samad.)</span> 'Ikrimah reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"This means the One Who all of the creation depends upon for their needs and their requests.\" 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn 'Abbas, \"He is the Master Who is perfect in His sovereignty, the Most Noble Who is perfect in His nobility, the Most Magnificent Who is perfect in His magnificence, the Most Forbearing Who is perfect in His forbearance, the All-Knowing Who is perfect in His knowledge, and the Most Wise Who is perfect in His wisdom. He is the One Who is perfect in all aspects of nobility and authority. He is Allah, glory be unto Him. These attributes are not befitting anyone other than Him. He has no coequal and nothing is like Him. Glory be to Allah, the One, the Irresistible.\" Al-A'mash reported from Shaqiq, who said that Abu Wa'il said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الصَّمَدُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(As-Samad.)</span> is the Master Whose control is complete.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah is Above having Children and procreating</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ - وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He begets not, nor was He begotten. And there is none comparable to Him.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, He does not have any child, parent or spouse. Mujahid said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And there is none comparable to Him.)</span> \"This means He does not have a spouse.\" This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَدِيعُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لَهُ وَلَدٌ وَلَمْ تَكُن لَّهُ صَاحِبَةٌ ۖ وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have children when He has no wife He created all things.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:101)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, He owns everything and He created everything. So how can He have a peer among His creatures who can be equal to Him, or a relative who can resemble Him? Glorified, Exalted and far removed is Allah from such a thing. </p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالُوا اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَلَدًا - لَّقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْئًا إِدًّا - تَكَادُ السَّمَاوَاتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنشَقُّ الْأَرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدًّا - أَن دَعَوْا لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ وَلَدًا - وَمَا يَنبَغِي لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَدًا - إِن كُلُّ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ إِلَّا آتِي الرَّحْمَٰنِ عَبْدًا - لَّقَدْ أَحْصَاهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدًّا - وَكُلُّهُمْ آتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَرْدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they say: Ar-Rahman has begotten a son. Indeed you have brought forth <span class=\"gray\">(said)</span> a terrible evil thing. Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins, that they ascribe a son to Ar-Rahman. But it is not suitable for Ar-Rahman that He should beget a son. There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto Ar-Rahman as a slave. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And all of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(19:88-95)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالُوا اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَلَدًا ۗ سُبْحَانَهُ ۚ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ - لَا يَسْبِقُونَهُ بِالْقَوْلِ وَهُم بِأَمْرِهِ يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they say: \"Ar-Rahman has begotten a son.
