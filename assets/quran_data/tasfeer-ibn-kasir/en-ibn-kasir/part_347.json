Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful. <span>(82)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>How Qarun and His Dwelling Place were swallowed up by the Earth</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">After telling us about Qarun's conceit and pride in his adornments, and how he was arrogant towards his people and transgressed against them, Allah then tells us how he and his dwelling place were swallowed up by the earth. This was also reported in the Sahih by Al-Bukhari from Salim, who said that his father told him that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَيْنَمَا رَجُلٌ يَجُرُّ إِزَارَهُ إِذْ خُسِفَ بِهِ، فَهُوَ يَتَجَلْجَلُ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(While a man was dragging his lower garment, he was swallowed up and he will remain sinking down into the earth until the Day of Resurrection.)</span> He also recorded something similar from Salim from Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet ﷺ. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa'id said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَيْنَمَا رَجُلٌ فِيمَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ خَرَجَ فِي بُرْدَيْنِ أَخْضَرَيْنِ يَخْتَالُ فِيهِمَا، أَمَرَ اللهُ الْأَرْضَ فَأَخَذَتْهُ، فَإِنَّهُ لَيَتَجَلْجَلُ فِيهَا إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When a man among the people who came before you went out wearing two green garments, walking proudly and arrogantly, Allah commanded the earth to swallow him up, and he will remain sinking down into it until the Day of Resurrection.)</span> This version was recorded only by Ahmad, and its chain of narration is Hasan <span class=\"gray\">(sound)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> فَمَا كَانَ لَهُ مِنْ فِئَةٍ يَنْصُرُونَهُ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُنْتَصِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then he had no group to help him against Allah, nor was he one of those who could save themselves.)</span> means, his wealth, group, servants and retinue were of no avail to him; they could not protect him from the wrath and vengeance of Allah. Nor could he help himself or save himself. There was no one to help him, neither himself nor anybody else.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>His People learned a Lesson from Him being swallowed up</h2></div><p lang=\"jv\" class=\"jv \">Allah's saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَصْبَحَ الَّذِينَ تَمَنَّوْا مَكَانَهُ بِالْأَمْسِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who had desired his position the day before,)</span> means, those witnessed him with his finery and said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ الَّذِينَ يُرِيدُونَ الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا يَا لَيْتَ لَنَا مِثْلَ مَا أُوتِيَ قَارُونُ إِنَّهُ لَذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who were desirous of the life of the world, said: \"Ah, would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(28:79)</span>When he was swallowed up in the earth, they began to say:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيْكَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْسُطُ الرِّزْقَ لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَقْدِرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Know you not that it is Allah Who expands the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His servants.)</span> Wealth does not indicate that Allah is pleased with its owner, for Allah gives and withholds, allows times of difficulty and times of ease, raises and lowers, His is the most complete wisdom and most convincing proof. According to a Hadith narrated by Ibn Mas'ud,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ قَسَمَ بَيْنَكُمْ أَخْلَاقَكُمْ كَمَا قَسَمَ أَرْزَاقَكُمْ، وَإِنَّ اللهَ يُعْطِي الْمَالَ مَنْ يُحِبُّ وَمَنْ لَا يُحِبُّ، وَلَا يُعْطِي الْإِيمَانَ إِلَّا مَنْ يُحِبُّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah has alloted character among you just as He has alloted your provision. Allah gives wealth to those whom He loves and those whom He does not love, but He gives Faith only to those whom He loves.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَوْلَا أَنْ مَنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا لَخَسَفَ بِنَا ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Had it not been that Allah was Gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up!)</span> meaning, 'were it not for the kindness and grace of Allah towards us, we could have been swallowed up by the earth just as he was swallowed up, because we wanted to be like him.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيْكَأَنَّهُ لَا يُفْلِحُ الْكَافِرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful.)</span> He was a disbeliever, and the disbelievers will never be successful before Allah in this world or in the Hereafter.</p>"

    "text": "<p class=\"en translation\" lang=\"en\">That is the home of the Hereafter, We shall assign to those who do not want to exalt themselves in the land nor cause corruption. And the good end is for those who have Taqwa <span>(83)</span>Whosoever brings good, he shall have the better thereof; and whosoever brings evil, then those who do evil deeds will only be requited for what they used to do <span>(84)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Blessings of the Hereafter for the humble Believers</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah tells us that He has made the home of the Hereafter, and its eternal delights which will never change or fade away, for His believing, humble servants who do not rebel against the truth with pride and oppression in the land. They do not exalt themselves above the creatures of Allah, arrogantly oppressing them and spreading corruption among them. 'Ikrimah said that this phrase referred to haughtiness and arrogance. Ibn Jurayj said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا يُرِيدُونَ عُلُوًّا فِي الْأَرْضِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(those who do not want to exalt themselves in the land)</span> \"Arrogance and tyranny,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا فَسَادًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(nor cause corruption)</span> committing sins.\" Ibn Jarir recorded that 'Ali said, \"If a man wants the straps of his sandals to be better than the straps of his companion's sandals, then he is one of those referred to in the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">تِلْكَ الدَّارُ الْآخِرَةُ نَجْعَلُهَا لِلَّذِينَ لَا يُرِيدُونَ عُلُوًّا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فَسَادًا ۚ وَالْعَاقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That is the home of the Hereafter, We shall assign to those who do not want to exalt themselves in the land nor cause corruption. And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.)</span> This is understood to mean that if his intention is to show off and appear better than others, then that is to be condemned, as it was reported in the Sahih that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّهُ أُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ أَنْ تَوَاضَعُوا حَتَّى لَا يَفْخَرَ أَحَدٌ عَلَى أَحَدٍ وَلَا يَبْغِي أَحَدٌ عَلَى أَحَدٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It has been revealed to me that you should be humble to the extent that none of you boasts to others or mistreats others.)</span> But if a person simply likes to look good, then there is nothing wrong with that. It was recorded that a man said: \"O Messenger of Allah, I like to have my garment looking good and my shoes looking good – is this a kind of arrogance?\" The Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا، إِنَّ اللهَ جَمِيلٌ يُحِبُّ الْجَمَالَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(No, for Allah is beautiful and loves beauty...)</span> And Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ جَاءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whosoever brings good,)</span> meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">فَلَهُ خَيْرٌ مِنْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(he shall have the better thereof;)</span> meaning, the reward of Allah is better than the good deeds of His servant – how can it not be, when Allah has multiplied it many times over? This is the position of generosity. Then Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ جَاءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلَا يُجْزَى الَّذِينَ عَمِلُوا السَّيِّئَاتِ إِلَّا مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and whosoever brings evil, then those who do evil deeds will only be requited for what they used to do.)</span> This is like the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ جَاءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَكُبَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فِي النَّارِ هَلْ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلَّا مَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whoever brings an evil deed, they will be cast down on their faces in the Fire. <span class=\"gray\">(And it will be said to them)</span> \"Are you being recompensed anything except what you used to do\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(27: 90)</span>. This is the postition of generosity and justice.</p>"
