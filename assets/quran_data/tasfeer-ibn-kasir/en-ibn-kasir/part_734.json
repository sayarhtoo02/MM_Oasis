The Jews broke the promises and vows that Allah took from them, and also rejected Allah's Ayat, meaning His signs and proofs, and the miracles that they witnessed at the hands of their Prophets. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَتْلِهِمُ الْأَنبِيَاءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and their killing the Prophets unjustly,)</span> because their many crimes and offenses against the Prophets of Allah, for they killed many Prophets, may Allah's peace be upon them Their saying:</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">قُلُوبُنَا غُلْفٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Our hearts are Ghulf,\")</span> meaning, wrapped with covering, according to Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, Sa'id bin Jubayr, 'Ikrimah, As-Suddi and Qatadah. This is similar to the what the idolators said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالُوا قُلُوبُنَا فِي أَكِنَّةٍ مِّمَّا تَدْعُونَا إِلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they say: \"Our hearts are under coverings <span class=\"gray\">(screened)</span> from that to which you invite us.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[41:5]</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَلْ طَبَعَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهَا بِكُفْرِهِمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(nay, Allah has set a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It is as if they had given an excuse that their hearts do not understand what the Prophet says since their hearts are wrapped with coverings, so they claim. Allah said that their hearts are sealed because of their disbelief, as we mentioned before in the explanation of Surat Al-Baqarah. Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا يُؤْمِنُونَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so they believe not but a little.)</span> for their hearts became accustomed to Kufr, transgression and weak faith.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Evil Accusation the Jews Uttered Against Maryam and Their Claim that They Killed 'Isa</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَبِكُفْرِهِمْ وَقَوْلِهِمْ عَلَىٰ مَرْيَمَ بُهْتَانًا عَظِيمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And because of their <span class=\"gray\">(Jews)</span> disbelief and uttering against Maryam a grave false charge.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">'Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn 'Abbas stated that the Jews accused Maryam of fornication.This is also the saying of As-Suddi, Juwaybir, Muhammad bin Ishaq and several others. This meaning is also apparent in the Ayah, as the Jews accused Maryam and her son of grave accusations: They accused her of fornication and claimed that 'Isa was an illegitimate son. Some of them even claimed that she was menstruating while fornicating. May Allah's continued curse be upon them until the Day of Resurrection. The Jews also said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّا قَتَلْنَا الْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"We killed Al-Masih, 'Isa, son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah,\")</span> meaning, we killed the person who claimed to be the Messenger of Allah. The Jews only uttered these words in jest and mockery, just as the polytheists said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِي نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ الذِّكْرُ إِنَّكَ لَمَجْنُونٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you to whom the Dhikr <span class=\"gray\">(the Qur'an)</span> has been sent down! Verily, you are a mad man!)</span><span class=\"gray\">[15:6]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When Allah sent 'Isa with proofs and guidance, the Jews, may Allah's curses, anger, torment and punishment be upon them, envied him because of his prophethood and obvious miracles; curing the blind and leprous and bringing the dead back to life, by Allah's leave. He also used to make the shape of a bird from clay and blow in it, and it became a bird by Allah's leave and flew. 'Isa performed other miracles that Allah honored him with, yet the Jews defied and bellied him and tried their best to harm him. Allah's Prophet 'Isa could not live in any one city for long and he had to travel often with his mother, peace be upon them. Even so, the Jews were not satisfied, and they went to the king of Damascus at that time, a Greek polytheist who worshipped the stars. They told him that there was a man in Bayt Al-Maqdis misguiding and dividing the people in Jerusalem and stirring unrest among the king's subjects. The king became angry and wrote to his deputy in Jerusalem to arrest the rebel leader, stop him from causing unrest, crucify him and make him wear a crown of thorns. When the king's deputy in Jerusalem received these orders, he went with some Jews to the house that 'Isa was residing in, and he was then with twelve, thirteen or seventeen of his companions. That day was a Friday, in the evening. They surrounded 'Isa in the house, and when he felt that they would soon enter the house or that he would sooner or later have to leave it, he said to his companions, \"Who volunteers to be made to look like me, for which he will be my companion in Paradise?\" A young man volunteered, but 'Isa thought that he was too young. He asked the question a second and third time, each time the young man volunteering, prompting 'Isa to say, \"Well then, you will be that man.\" Allah made the young man look exactly like 'Isa, while a hole opened in the roof of the house, and 'Isa was made to sleep and ascended to heaven while asleep. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذْ قَالَ اللَّهُ يَا عِيسَىٰ إِنِّي مُتَوَفِّيكَ وَرَافِعُكَ إِلَيَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And <span class=\"gray\">(remember)</span> when Allah said: \"O 'Isa! I will take you and raise you to Myself.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When 'Isa ascended, those who were in the house came out. When those surrounding the house saw the man who looked like 'Isa, they thought that he was 'Isa. So they took him at night, crucified him and placed a crown of thorns on his head. The Jews then boasted that they killed 'Isa and some Christians accepted their false claim, due to their ignorance and lack of reason. As for those who were in the house with 'Isa, they witnessed his ascension to heaven, while the rest thought that the Jews killed 'Isa by crucifixion. They even said that Maryam sat under the corpse of the crucified man and cried, and they say that the dead man spoke to her. All this was a test from Allah for His servants out of His wisdom.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah explained this matter in the Glorious Qur'an which He sent to His honorable Messenger, whom He supported with miracles and clear, unequivocal evidence. Allah is the Most Truthful, and He is the Lord of the worlds Who knows the secrets, what the hearts conceal, the hidden matters in heaven and earth, what has occurred, what will occur, and what would occur if it was decreed. He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ وَمَا صَلَبُوهُ وَلَٰكِن شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared as that to them,)</span> referring to the person whom the Jews thought was 'Isa. This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مَا لَهُم بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِلَّا اتِّبَاعَ الظَّنِّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no <span class=\"gray\">(certain)</span> knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture.)</span> referring to the Jews who claimed to kill 'Isa and the ignorant Christians who believed them. Indeed they are all in confusion, misguidance and bewilderment. This is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ يَقِينًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(For surely; they killed him not.)</span> meaning they are not sure that 'Isa was the one whom they killed. Rather, they are in doubt and confusion over this matter.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَل رَّفَعَهُ اللَّهُ إِلَيْهِ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَزِيزًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But Allah raised him up unto Himself. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful,)</span> meaning, He is the Almighty, and He is never weak, nor will those who seek refuge in Him ever be subjected to disgrace,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَكِيمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(All-Wise.)</span> in all that He decides and ordains for His creatures. Indeed, Allah's is the clearest wisdom, unequivocal proof and the most glorious authority. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Just before Allah raised 'Isa to the heavens, 'Isa went to his companions, who were twelve inside the house. When he arrived, his hair was dripping water and he said, 'There are those among you who will disbelieve in me twelve times after he had believed in me.' He then asked, 'Who volunteers that his image appear as mine, and be killed in my place. He will be with me <span class=\"gray\">(in Paradise)</span>?' One of the youngest ones among them volunteered and 'Isa asked him to sit down. 'Isa again asked for a volunteer, and the young man kept volunteering and 'Isa asking him to sit down. Then the young man volunteered again and 'Isa said, 'You will be that man,' and the resemblance of 'Isa was cast over that man while 'Isa ascended to heaven from a hole in the house. When the Jews came looking for 'Isa, they found that young man and crucified him. Some of 'Isa's followers disbelieved in him twelve times after they had believed in him. They then divided into three groups. One group, Al-Ya'qubiyyah <span class=\"gray\">(Jacobites)</span>, said, 'Allah remained with us as long as He willed and then ascended to heaven.' Another group, An-Nasturiyyah <span class=\"gray\">(Nestorians)</span>, said, 'The son of Allah was with us as long as he willed and Allah took him to heaven.' Another group, Muslims, said, 'The servant and Messenger of Allah remained with us as long as Allah willed, and Allah then took him to Him.' The two disbelieving groups cooperated against the Muslim group and they killed them. Ever since that happened, Islam was then veiled until Allah sent Muhammad ﷺ.\" This statement has an authentic chain of narration leading to Ibn 'Abbas, and An-Nasa'i narrated it through Abu Kurayb who reported it from Abu Mu'awiyah. Many among the Salaf stated that 'Isa asked if someone would volunteer for his appearance to be cast over him, and that he will be killed instead of 'Isa, for which he would be his companion in Paradise.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>All Christians Will Believe in 'Isa Before He Dies</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ إِلَّا لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And there is none of the People of the Scripture, but must believe in him, before his death.

Then there will be an abundance of wealth and nobody will accept charitable gifts any more. At that time, one prostration will be better for them than this life and all that is in it.)</span> Abu Hurayrah then said, \"Read if you will,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ إِلَّا لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And there is none of the People of the Scripture, but must believe in him, before his death.
