In another Ayah, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ عَلِمَ اللَّهُ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا لَّأَسْمَعَهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Had Allah known of any good in them, He would indeed have made them listen.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[8:23]</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءُوكَ يُجَادِلُونَكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(to the point that when they come to you to argue with you...)</span> using falsehood against truth,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَقُولُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا إِنْ هَٰذَا إِلَّا أَسَاطِيرُ الْأَوَّلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(those who disbelieve say: \"These are nothing but tales of the men of old.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The disbelievers say, what you <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad ﷺ)</span> brought us was taken from the books of those who were before us, meaning plagiarized,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">وَهُمْ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ وَيَنْأَوْنَ عَنْهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they prevent others from him and they themselves keep away from him,)</span> They discourage people from following the truth, believing in Muhammad ﷺ and obeying the Qur'an,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَنْأَوْنَ عَنْهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and they themselves keep away from him,)</span> They thus combine both evil acts, for they neither benefit themselves, nor let others benefit from the Prophet ﷺ. 'Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn 'Abbas said that the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُمْ يَنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they prevent others from him.)</span> means, they hinder people from believing in Muhammad ﷺ. Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah said, \"The disbelievers of Quraysh used to refrain from meeting Muhammad ﷺ and they discouraged people from coming to him.\" Similar was reported from Qatadah, Mujahid and Ad-Dahhak and several others.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِن يُهْلِكُونَ إِلَّا أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and <span class=\"gray\">(by doing so)</span> they destroy not but themselves, yet they perceive <span class=\"gray\">(it)</span> not.)</span> They destroy themselves by committing this evil action, and its harm will only touch them. Yet, they do not perceive this fact!</p>"
