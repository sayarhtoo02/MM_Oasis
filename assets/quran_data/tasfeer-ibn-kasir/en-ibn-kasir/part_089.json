Their actions vanished from them when they were most in need of their rewards.

Do not render in vain your Sadaqah <span class=\"gray\">(charity)</span> by reminders of your generosity or by injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he does not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day. His parable is that of a smooth rock on which is a little dust; on it falls heavy rain which leaves it bare. They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:264]</span> Allah said in this Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الضَّلَالُ الْبَعِيدُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That is the straying, far away from the right path)</span> meaning, their work and deeds were not based on firm, correct grounds, and thus, they lost their rewards when they needed them the most,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الضَّلَالُ الْبَعِيدُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That is the straying, far away from the right path.)</span></p>"
