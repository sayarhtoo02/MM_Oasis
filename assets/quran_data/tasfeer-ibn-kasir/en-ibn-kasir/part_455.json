    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And We said: \"O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimin <span class=\"gray\">(wrongdoers)</span>. <span>(35)</span>Then the Shaytan made them slip therefrom <span class=\"gray\">(the Paradise)</span>, and got them out from that in which they were. We said: \"Get you down, all, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time. <span>(36)</span></p><div lang=\"id\" class=\"id \"><h2>Adam was honored again</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah honored Adam by commanding the angels to prostrate before him, so they all complied except for Iblis. Allah then allowed Adam to live and eat wherever and whatever he wished in Paradise. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah reported Abu Dharr saying, \"I said, 'O Messenger of Allah! Was Adam a Prophet?' He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نَعَمْ نَبِيًّا رَسُولًا كَلَّمَهُ اللَّهُ قُبُلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yes. He was a Prophet and a Messenger to whom Allah spoke directly)</span>, meaning</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اسْكُنْ أَنتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(O Adam!)</span> Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise.)</span>\"</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Hawwa' was created before Adam entered Paradise</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:35)</span> indicates that Hawwa' was created before Adam entered Paradise, as Muhammad bin Ishaq stated. Ibn Ishaq said, \"After Allah finished criticizing Iblis, and after teaching Adam the names of everything, He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَـاءَادَمُ أَنبِئْهُم بِأَسْمَآئِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"pt\" class=\"pt \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Adam! Inform them of their names)</span> until,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, You are the Knower, the Wise.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Adam fell asleep, as the People of the Book and other scholars such as Ibn 'Abbas have stated, Allah took one of Adam's left ribs and made flesh grow in its place, while Adam was asleep and unaware. Allah then created Adam's wife, Hawwa', from his rib and made her a woman, so that she could be a comfort for him. When Adam woke up and saw Hawwa' next to him, it was claimed, he said, 'My flesh and blood, my wife.' Hence, Adam reclined with Hawwa'. When Allah married Adam to Hawwa' and gave him comfort, Allah said to him directly,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا آدَمُ اسْكُنْ أَنتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ وَكُلَا مِنْهَا رَغَدًا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلَا تَقْرَبَا هَٰذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimin <span class=\"gray\">(wrongdoers)</span>.\")</span>.\"</p><div lang=\"id\" class=\"id \"><h2>Allah tests Adam</h2></div><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement to Adam,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَقْرَبَا هَٰذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but come not near this tree)</span> is a test for Adam. There are conflicting opinions over the nature of the tree mentioned here. Some said that it was the grape tree, barley, date tree, fig tree, and so forth. Some said that it was a certain tree, and whoever eats from it will be relieved of the call of nature. It was also said that it was a tree from which the angels eat so that they live for eternity. Imam Abu Ja'far bin Jarir said, \"The correct opinion is that Allah forbade Adam and his wife from eating from a certain tree in Paradise, but they ate from it. We do not know which tree that was, because Allah has not mentioned anything in the Qur'an or the authentic Sunnah about the nature of this tree. It was said that it was barley, grape, or a fig tree. It is possible that it was one of those trees. Yet, this is knowledge that does not bring any benefit, just as being ignorant in its nature does no harm. Allah knows best.\" This is similar to what Ar-Razi stated in his Tafsir, and this is the correct opinion. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَانُ عَنْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then the Shaytan made them slip therefrom)</span> either refers to Paradise, and in this case, it means that Shaytan led Adam and Hawwa' away from it, as 'Asim bin Abi An-Najud recited it. It is also possible that this Ayah refers to the forbidden tree. In this case, the Ayah would mean, as Al-Hasan and Qatadah stated, \"He tripped them.\" In this case,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَانُ عَنْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then the Shaytan made them slip therefrom)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">means, \"Because of the tree\", just as Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُؤْفَكُ عَنْهُ مَنْ أُفِكَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Turned aside therefrom <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. from Muhammad and the Qur'an)</span> is he who is turned aside <span class=\"gray\">(by the decree and preordainment of Allah)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">(51:9)</span> meaning, the deviant person becomes turned aside - or slips - from the truth because of so and so reason. This is why then Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَخْرَجَهُمَا مِمَّا كَانَا فِيهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And got them out from that in which they were)</span> meaning, the clothes, spacious dwelling and comfortable sustenance.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقُلْنَا اهْبِطُوا بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ وَلَكُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمَتَاعٌ إِلَىٰ حِينٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We said: \"Get you down, all, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time.\")</span> meaning, dwelling, sustenance and limited life, until the commencement of the Day of Resurrection.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Adam was very Tall</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Ubayy bin Ka'b said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ خَلَقَ آدَمَ رَجُلًا طُوَالًا كَثِيرَ شَعْرِ الرَّأْسِ كَأَنَّهُ نَخْلَةٌ سَحُوقٌ، فَلَمَّا ذَاقَ الشَّجَرَةَ سَقَطَ عَنْهُ لِبَاسُهُ فَأَوَّلُ مَا بَدَا مِنْهُ عَوْرَتُهُ، فَلَمَّا نَظَرَ إلى عَوْرتِه جَعَلَ يَشْتَدُّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ فَأَخَذَتْ شَعْرَهُ شَجَرَةٌ فَنَازَعَهَا، فَنَادَاهُ الرَّحْمٰنُ: يَا آدَمُ مِنِّي تَفِرُّ؟ فَلَمَّا سَمِعَ كَلامَ الرَّحْمٰنِ قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ لَا ولَكِنِ اسْتِحْيَاءً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah created Adam tall, with thick hair, just as a date tree with full branches. When Adam ate from the forbidden tree, his cover fell off, and the first thing that appeared was his private area. When he saw his private area, he ran away in Paradise and his hair got caught in a tree. He tried to free himself and Ar-Rahman called him, 'O Adam! Are you running away from Me?' When Adam heard the words of Ar-Rahman <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span>, he said, 'No, O my Lord! But I am shy.')</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Adam remained in Paradise for an Hour</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Hakim recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Adam was allowed to reside in Paradise during the time period between the 'Asr <span class=\"gray\">(Afternoon)</span> prayer, until sunset.\" Al-Hakim then commented this is \"Sahih according to the Two Shaykhs <span class=\"gray\">(Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</span>, but they did not include it in their collections.\" Also, Ibn Abi Hatim recorded Ibn 'Abbas saying, \"Allah sent Adam to earth to an area called, Dahna, between Makkah and At-Ta'if.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that Adam was sent down to India, while Hawwa' was sent to Jeddah. Iblis was sent down to Dustumaysan, several miles from Basra. Further, the snake was sent down to Asbahan. This was reported by Ibn Abi Hatim. Also, Muslim and An-Nasa'i recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خَيْرُ يَوْمٍ طَلَعَتْ فِيهِ الشَّمْسُ يَوْمُ الْجُمُعَةِ فِيهِ خُلِقَ آدَمُ وَفِيهِ أُدْخِلَ الْجَنَّةَ وَفِيهِ أُخْرِجَ مِنْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Friday is the best day on which the sun has risen. On Friday, Allah created Adam, admitted him into Paradise, and expelled him from it.)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>A Doubt and a Rebuttal</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">If one asks, \"If the Paradise that Adam was thrown out of was in heaven, as the majority of the scholars assert, then is it possible for Iblis to enter Paradise, although he was expelled from it by Allah's decision <span class=\"gray\">(when he refused to prostrate before Adam)</span>?\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Basically, the response to this would be that the Paradise which Adam was in, was in the heavens, not on the earth, as we explained in the beginning of our book Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The majority of scholars said that Shaytan was originally prohibited from entering Paradise, but there were times when he sneaked into it in secret. For instance, the Tawrah stated that Iblis hid inside the snake's mouth and entered Paradise. Some scholars said that it is possible that Shaytan led Adam and Hawwa' astray on his way out of Paradise. Some scholars said that he led Adam and Hawwa' astray when he was on earth, while they were still in heaven, as stated by Az-Zamakhshari. Al-Qurtubi mentioned several beneficial Hadiths here about snakes and the ruling on killing them.</p>"

As-Suddi said that Ibn 'Abbas commented on,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَتَلَقَّىٰ آدَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then Adam received from his Lord Words)</span> \"Adam said, 'O Lord!

Does not Your mercy precede Your anger?' He was told, 'Yes.' Adam said, 'And You destined me to commit this evil act?' He was told, 'Yes.' He said, 'If I repent, will You send me back to Paradise?' Allah said, 'Yes.'\" Similar is reported from Al-'Awfi, Sa'id bin Jubayr, Sa'id bin Ma'bad, and Ibn 'Abbas. Al-Hakim recorded this Hadith in his Mustadrak from Ibn Jubayr, who narrated it from Ibn 'Abbas. Al-Hakim said, \"Its chain is Sahih and they <span class=\"gray\">(Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</span> did not record it.\"</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّهُ هُوَ التَّوَّابُ الرَّحِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, He is the One Who forgives <span class=\"gray\">(accepts repentance)</span>, the Most Merciful)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:37)</span> means that Allah forgives whoever regrets his error and returns to Him in repentance. This meaning is similar to Allah's statements,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ يَقْبَلُ التَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His servants)</span><span class=\"gray\">(9:104)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءًا أَوْ يَظْلِمْ نَفْسَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whoever does evil or wrongs himself)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:110)</span> and</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن تَابَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds)</span><span class=\"gray\">(25:71)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Ayat mentioned above, testify to the fact that Allah forgives the sins of whoever repents, demonstrating His kindness and mercy towards His creation and servants.
