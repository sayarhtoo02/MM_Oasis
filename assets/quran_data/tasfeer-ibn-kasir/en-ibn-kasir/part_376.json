Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُل لِّي عَمَلِي وَلَكُمْ عَمَلُكُمْ ۖ أَنتُم بَرِيئُونَ مِمَّا أَعْمَلُ وَأَنَا بَرِيءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if they belie you, say: \"For me are my deeds and for you are your deeds!

Allah said about Ibrahim,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَحَاجَّهُ قَوْمُهُ قَالَ أَتُحَاجُّونِّي فِي اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(His people disputed with him.

Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> قُلْ أَأَنتُمْ أَعْلَمُ أَمِ اللَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say, \"Do you know better or does Allah?\")</span> meaning, Allah has the best knowledge and He stated that they were neither Jews, nor Christians. Similarly, Allah said in the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا كَانَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ يَهُودِيًّا وَلَا نَصْرَانِيًّا وَلَٰكِن كَانَ حَنِيفًا مُّسْلِمًا وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa <span class=\"gray\">(to worship none but Allah alone)</span> and he was not of Al-Mushrikin)</span><span class=\"gray\">(3:67)</span> and the following Ayat. Allah also said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن كَتَمَ شَهَادَةً عِندَهُ مِنَ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And who is more unjust than he who conceals the testimony he has from Allah? <span class=\"gray\">(2:140)</span> Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, They used to recite the Book of Allah He sent to them that stated that the true religion is Islam and that Muhammad ﷺ is the Messenger of Allah. Their Book also stated that Ibrahim, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub and the tribes were neither Jews, nor Christians. They testified to these facts, yet hid them from the people. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah is not unaware of what you do)</span>, is a threat and a warning that His knowledge encompasses every one's deeds, and He shall award each accordingly. Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That was a nation who has passed away.)</span> meaning, existed before you,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُم مَّا كَسَبْتُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They shall receive the reward of what they earned, and you of what you earn.)</span> meaning, they bear their deeds while you bear yours,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تُسْأَلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And you will not be asked of what they used to do)</span> meaning, the fact that you are their relatives will not suffice, unless you imitate their good deeds. Further, do not be deceived by the fact that you are their descendants, unless you imitate them in obeying Allah's orders and following His Messengers who were sent as warners and bearers of good news. Indeed, whoever disbelieves in even one Prophet, will have disbelieved in all the Messengers, especially if one disbelieves in the master and Final Messenger from Allah, the Lord of the worlds, to all mankind and the Jinns. May Allah's peace and blessings be on Muhammad ﷺ and the rest of Allah's Prophets.</p>"
