    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And when a Surah is revealed, enjoining them to believe in Allah and to strive hard and fight along with His Messenger, the wealthy among them ask your leave to exempt them and say, \"Leave us <span class=\"gray\">(behind)</span>, we would be with those who sit <span class=\"gray\">(at home)</span>. <span>(86)</span>They are content to be with those who sit behind.

They asked the Messenger ﷺ for permission to stay behind, saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَرْنَا نَكُن مَّعَ الْقَاعِدِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Leave us <span class=\"gray\">(behind)</span>, we would be with those who sit <span class=\"gray\">(at home)</span>\")</span> thus accepting for themselves the shame of lagging behind with women, after the army had left. If war starts, such people are the most cowardice, but when it is safe, they are the most boastful among men. Allah described them in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِذَا جَاءَ الْخَوْفُ رَأَيْتَهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ تَدُورُ أَعْيُنُهُمْ كَالَّذِي يُغْشَىٰ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ ۖ فَإِذَا ذَهَبَ الْخَوْفُ سَلَقُوكُم بِأَلْسِنَةٍ حِدَادٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving like <span class=\"gray\">(those of)</span> one over whom hovers death; but when the fear departs, they will smite you with sharp tongues.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[33:19]</span> their tongues direct their harsh words against you, when it is safe to do so. In battle, however, they are the most cowardice among men. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَوْلَا نُزِّلَتْ سُورَةٌ ۖ فَإِذَا أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ مُّحْكَمَةٌ وَذُكِرَ فِيهَا الْقِتَالُ ۙ رَأَيْتَ الَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ نَظَرَ الْمَغْشِيِّ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ ۖ فَأَوْلَىٰ لَهُمْ - طَاعَةٌ وَقَوْلٌ مَّعْرُوفٌ ۚ فَإِذَا عَزَمَ الْأَمْرُ فَلَوْ صَدَقُوا اللَّهَ لَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَّهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who believe say: \"Why is not a Surah sent down <span class=\"gray\">(for us)</span>? But when a decisive Surah <span class=\"gray\">(explaining and ordering things)</span> is sent down, and fighting is mentioned therein, you will see those in whose hearts is a disease looking at you with a look of one fainting to death. But it was better for them. Obedience <span class=\"gray\">(to Allah)</span> and good words <span class=\"gray\">(were better for them)</span>. And when the matter is resolved on, then if they had been true to Allah, it would have been better for them.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[47:20-21]</span></p><p lang=\"el-Latn\" class=\"el-Latn \">Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَطُبِعَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Their hearts are sealed up)</span> because of their staying away from Jihad and from accompanying the Messenger ﷺ in Allah's cause,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَهُمْ لَا يَفْقَهُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so they understand not.)</span> they neither understand what benefits them so that they perform it nor what hurts them so that they avoid it.</p>"
