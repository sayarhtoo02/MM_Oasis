    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The disbelievers pretend that they will never be resurrected. Say: \"Yes! By my Lord, you will certainly be resurrected, then you will be informed of what you did; and that is easy for Allah. <span>(7)</span>Therefore, believe in Allah and His Messenger and in the Light which We have sent down. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do <span>(8)</span>The Day when He will gather you on the Day of Gathering, that will be the Day of At-Taghabun.

The first is in Surah Yunus,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَسْتَنْبِئُونَكَ أَحَقٌّ هُوَ ۖ قُلْ إِي وَرَبِّي إِنَّهُ لَحَقٌّ ۖ وَمَا أَنْتُمْ بِمُعْجِزِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they ask you to inform them: \"Is it true?\" Say: \"Yes!

Say: \"Yes! By my Lord, you will certainly be resurrected, then you will be informed of what you did; and that is easy for Allah.\")</span> Allah the Exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَآمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَالنُّورِ الَّذِي أَنْزَلْنَا ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Therefore, believe in Allah and in His Messenger and in the Light which We have sent down.)</span> that is, the Qur'an,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.)</span> none of your deeds ever escapes His knowledge.</p><p lang=\"ga\" class=\"ga \">The Day of At-Taghabun</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُكُمْ لِيَوْمِ الْجَمْعِ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Day when He will gather you on the Day of Gathering,)</span> meaning the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day when the earlier and later generations will all be gathered in one area, a caller would be heard by them all, and one's vision would easily see them all. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَٰلِكَ يَوْمٌ مَجْمُوعٌ لَهُ النَّاسُ وَذَٰلِكَ يَوْمٌ مَشْهُودٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That is the Day whereon mankind will be gathered together, that is a Day when all will be present.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11:103)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ إِنَّ الْأَوَّلِينَ وَالْآخِرِينَ - لَمَجْمُوعُونَ إِلَىٰ مِيقَاتِ يَوْمٍ مَعْلُومٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"<span class=\"gray\">(Yes)</span> verily, those of old, and those of later times.

But those who disbelieved and denied Our Ayat, they will be the dwellers of the Fire, to dwell therein forever. And worst indeed is that destination.)</span> We explained these meanings several times before.</p>"
