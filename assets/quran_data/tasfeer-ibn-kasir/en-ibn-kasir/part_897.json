    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Who is it besides the Most Gracious that can be an army to you to help you? The disbelievers are in nothing but delusion <span>(20)</span>Who is it that can provide for you if He should withhold His provision? Nay, but they continue to be in pride, and flee <span>(21)</span>Is he who walks prone on his face, more rightly guided, or he who walks upright on a straight path <span>(22)</span>Say: \"It is He Who has created you, and endowed you with hearing and seeing, and hearts. Little thanks you give. <span>(23)</span>Say: \"It is He Who has created you on the earth, and to Him shall you be gathered. <span>(24)</span>They say: \"When will this promise come to pass, if you are telling the truth? <span>(25)</span>Say: \"The knowledge is with Allah only, and I am only a plain warner. <span>(26)</span>But when they will see it approaching, the faces of those who disbelieve will be sad and grievous, and it will be said: \"This is what you were calling for! <span>(27)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">No One will help You and No One can grant Sustenance except for Allah</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah addresses the idolators who worship others besides Him, seeking help and sustenance from them. Allah rebukes them for what they believe, and He informs them that they will not attain that which they hope for. Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمَّنْ هَٰذَا الَّذِي هُوَ جُنْدٌ لَكُمْ يَنْصُرُكُمْ مِنْ دُونِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who is it besides the Most Gracious that can be an army to you to help?)</span> imeaning, there is no protector or helper for you besides Him. This is the reason that Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> إِنِ الْكَافِرُونَ إِلَّا فِي غُرُورٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The disbelievers are in nothing but delusion.)</span> Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمَّنْ هَٰذَا الَّذِي يَرْزُقُكُمْ إِنْ أَمْسَكَ رِزْقَهُ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who is it that can provide for you if He should withhold His provision?)</span> meaning, who is it that can provide for you if Allah cuts off your sustenance? There is no one who gives, withholds, creates, provides and helps other than Allah alone, Who has no partner. This proves that they know this, yet they still worship others besides Him. Thus, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> بَلْ لَجُّوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Nay, but they continue)</span> meaning, they persist in their transgression, lying and misguidance.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِي عُتُوٍّ وَنُفُورٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(to be in pride, and flee.)</span> meaning, they continue in obstinance, arrogance and fleeing away from the truth. They do not listen to it nor do they follow it.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Parable of the Disbeliever and the Believer</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَمَنْ يَمْشِي مُكِبًّا عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهِ أَهْدَىٰ أَمَّنْ يَمْشِي سَوِيًّا عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Is he who walks prone on his face, more rightly guided, or he who walks upright on a straight path?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is a parable which Allah made of the believer and the disbeliever. So the condition of the disbeliever is like one who walks prone on his face. This is like a person walking bent over on his face <span class=\"gray\">(with his head down)</span> instead of walking upright. This person does not know where he is going or how. Rather, he is lost, astray and confused. Is this person more guided,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\"> أَمَّنْ يَمْشِي سَوِيًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(or he who walks upright)</span> meaning, he who stands erect.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(on a straight path?)</span> meaning, this person who walks upright is on a clear path, and he is straight within himself while his path is straight as well. This is their likeness in this world, and their likeness will be the same in the Hereafter. So the believer will be gathered <span class=\"gray\">(on the Day of Judgement)</span> walking upright upon the straight path and the vast and spacious Paradise will be opened up for him. However, the disbeliever will be gathered walking down on his face to the Hellfire.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">احْشُرُوا الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا وَأَزْوَاجَهُمْ وَمَا كَانُوا يَعْبُدُونَ - مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ فَاهْدُوهُمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطِ الْجَحِيمِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Assemble those who did wrong, together with their companions and what they used to worship instead of Allah, and lead them on to the way of flaming Fire.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(37:22,23)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"Companions\" here means those like them. Imam Ahmad recorded from Anas bin Malik that it was said, \"O Messenger of Allah! How will the people be gathered on their faces?\" So the Prophet ﷺ replied,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَيْسَ الَّذِي أَمْشَاهُمْ عَلَى أَرْجُلِهِمْ قَادِرًا عَلَى أَنْ يُمْشِيَهُمْ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Is not He who made them to walk on their legs able to make them walk on their faces?\")</span> This Hadith is also recorded in the Two Sahihs.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah's Power to create and It being an Evidence of the Final Abode</p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ هُوَ الَّذِي أَنْشَأَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say it is He Who has created you,)</span> meaning, He initiated your creation after you were not even a thing worth mentioning <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., nothing)</span>. Then He says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ السَّمْعَ وَالْأَبْصَارَ وَالْأَفْئِدَةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and endowed you with hearing and seeing, and hearts.)</span> meaning, intellects and powers of reasoning.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">قَلِيلًا مَا تَشْكُرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Little thanks you give.)</span> meaning, how little you use these abilities that Allah has blessed you with to obey Him, to act according to His commandments, and avoid His prohibitions.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ هُوَ الَّذِي ذَرَأَكُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"It is He Who has created you on the earth...\")</span> meaning, He has spread and distributed you all througout the various regions and areas of the earth with your differing languages, colors, shapes, appearances and forms.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَإِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and to Him shall you be gathered.)</span> meaning, you all will come together after this separation and division. He will gather you all just as He separated you and He will bring you back again just as He originated you. Then while informing of the disbelievers who reject the final return, and doubt concerning its real occurrence, Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَىٰ هَٰذَا الْوَعْدُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They say: \"When will this promise come to pass if you are telling the truth?\")</span> meaning, 'when will this gathering after separation that you are informing us of, occur?'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ إِنَّمَا الْعِلْمُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"The knowledge is with Allah only...\")</span> meaning, 'no one knows the time of the Day of Judgement exactly except Allah, but He has commanded me to inform you that it is real and it will definitely occur, so beware of it.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّمَا أَنَا نَذِيرٌ مُبِينٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and I am only a plain warner.)</span> meaning, 'I am only obligated to convey, and verily I have performed my duty <span class=\"gray\">(of conveying)</span> towards you.' Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ زُلْفَةً سِيئَتْ وُجُوهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But when they will see it approaching, the faces of those who disbelieve will be sad and grievous.)</span> means, when the Day of Judgement begins, and the disbelievers witness it, and they see that the matter has drawn close, because everything that is to occur will occur, even if it takes a long time. So, when what they denied occurs, it will grieve them because they will know what is awaiting them there <span class=\"gray\">(in Hell)</span> of the worst evil. This means that it will surround them and Allah will command what they were not able to reckon or fully comprehend to come to them.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَبَدَا لَهُمْ مِنَ اللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يَكُونُوا يَحْتَسِبُونَ - وَبَدَا لَهُمْ سَيِّئَاتُ مَا كَسَبُوا وَحَاقَ بِهِمْ مَا كَانُوا بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if those who did wrong had all that is in the earth entirely and the like of it with it, they would <span class=\"gray\">[attempt to]</span> ransom themselves thereby from the worst of the punishment on the Day of Resurrection. And there will appear to them from Allah that which they had not taken into account.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(39:47-48)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is why it will be said to them in order to scold and reprimand them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَٰذَا الَّذِي كُنْتُمْ بِهِ تَدَّعُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(This is what you were calling for!)</span> meaning, that you were seeking to hasten.</p>"

If Allah destroys me, and those with me, or He bestows His mercy on us - who can save the disbelievers from a painful torment?)</span> meaning, 'save yourselves, for verily, there is nothing that can rescue you from Allah except repentance, turning to Him for forgiveness and returning to His religion. Your hopes that torment and exemplary punishment will strike us, will not benefit you. Whether Allah punishes us or has mercy on us, there is no escaping from Allah's punishment and painful torment that you will suffer.' Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ هُوَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ آمَنَّا بِهِ وَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"He is the Most Gracious, in Him we believe, and upon Him we rely.)</span> meaning, 'we believe in the Lord of all that exists, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, and upon Him we rely in all of our affairs.' This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> فَاعْبُدْهُ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So worship Him and rely upon Him.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11:123)</span> Thus, Allah continues saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ هُوَ فِي ضَلَالٍ مُبِينٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So, you will come to know who it is that is in manifest error.)</span> meaning, 'between Us and you, and to whom the final end <span class=\"gray\">(ultimate victory)</span> will be for in this life and in the Hereafter.'</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Reminding of Allah's Blessing by the springing of Water and the Threat of It being taken away </p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">Allah says;</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ أَصْبَحَ مَاؤُكُمْ غَوْرًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"Tell me!

'Gha'ir' <span class=\"gray\">(sinking)</span> as used here in the Ayah, is the opposite of springing forth.

This means that no one is able to do this except Allah. So, it is merely out of His favor and His grace that He causes water to spring forth for you, and He makes it run to the various regions of the earth in an amount that is suitable for the needs of servants, be it little or abundant.
