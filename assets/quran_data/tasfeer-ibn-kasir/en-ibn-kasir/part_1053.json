    "text": "<p class=\"en translation\" lang=\"en\">And fear the Fitnah <span class=\"gray\">(affliction and trial)</span> which affects not in particular <span class=\"gray\">(only)</span> those of you who do wrong, and know that Allah is severe in punishment <span>(25)</span></p><div lang=\"fil\" class=\"fil \"><h2>Warning against an encompassing Fitnah</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah warns His believing servants of a Fitnah, trial and test, that encompasses the wicked and those around them. Therefore, such Fitnah will not be restricted to the sinners and evildoers. Rather, it will reach the others if the sins are not stopped and prevented. Imam Ahmad recorded that Mutarrif said, \"We asked Az-Zubayr, 'O Abu 'Abdullah! What brought you here <span class=\"gray\">(for the battle of Al-Jamal)</span>? You abandoned the Khalifah who was assassinated <span class=\"gray\">('Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him)</span> and then came asking for revenge for his blood' He said, 'We recited at the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاتَّقُوا فِتْنَةً لَّا تُصِيبَنَّ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا مِنكُمْ خَاصَّةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And fear the Fitnah <span class=\"gray\">(affliction and trial)</span> which affects not in particular <span class=\"gray\">(only)</span> those of you who do wrong,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">We did not think that this Ayah was about us too, until it reached us as it did.'\" 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas said that the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاتَّقُوا فِتْنَةً لَّا تُصِيبَنَّ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا مِنكُمْ خَاصَّةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And fear the Fitnah <span class=\"gray\">(affliction and trial)</span> which affects not in particular <span class=\"gray\">(only)</span> those of you who do wrong,)</span> refers to the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ in particular. In another narration from Ibn 'Abbas, he said, \"Allah commanded the believers to stop evil from flourishing among them, so that Allah does not encompass them all in the torment <span class=\"gray\">(Fitnah)</span>. \" This, indeed, is a very good explanation, prompting Mujahid to comment about Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاتَّقُوا فِتْنَةً لَّا تُصِيبَنَّ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا مِنكُمْ خَاصَّةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And fear the Fitnah <span class=\"gray\">(affliction and trial)</span> which affects not in particular <span class=\"gray\">(only)</span> those of you who do wrong,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"Is for you too!\" Several said similarly, such as Ad-Dahhak and Yazid bin Abi Habib and several others. Ibn Mas'ud said, \"There is none among you but there is something that represents a Fitnah for him, for Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّمَا أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَأَوْلَادُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Your wealth and your children are only a trial <span class=\"gray\">(Fitnah)</span>...)</span><span class=\"gray\">[64:15]</span>. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, when you seek refuge, seek it with Allah from the Fitnah that causes misguidance.\" Ibn Jarir collected this Hadith. The view that the warning in this Ayah addresses the Companions and all others is true, even though the speech in the Ayah was directed at the Companions. There are Hadiths that warn against Fitnah in general, thus providing the correctness of this explanation. Similarly there will be a separate book in which this subject will be discussed, Allah willing, as also is the case with the Imams, there being a number of writings about this. Of the most precise things that have been mentioned under this topic, is what was recorded by Imam Ahmad from Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ! لَتَأْمُرُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَلَتَنْهَوُنَّ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ أَوْ لَيُوشِكَنَّ اللهُ أَنْ يَبْعَثَ عَلَيْكُمْ عِقَابًا مِنْ عِنْدِهِ ثُمَّ لَتَدْعُنَّهُ فَلَا يَسْتَجِيبُ لَكُم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! You will enjoin righteousness and forbid evil, or Allah will send a punishment upon you from Him; you will supplicate then to Him, but He will not answer your supplication.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Ar-Riqad said, \"I heard Hudhayfah saying, 'A person used to utter one word during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and become a hypocrite on account of it. I now hear such words from one of you four times in the same sitting. Surely, you will enjoin good, forbid evil and encourage each other to do good or Allah will surround you all with torment, or make the wicked among you become your leaders. The righteous among you will then supplicate, but their supplication will not be accepted.'\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that An-Nu'man bin Bashir said that the Prophet ﷺ gave a speech in which he said, while pointing to his ears with two of his fingers,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَثَلُ الْقَائِمِ عَلَى حُدُودِ اللهِ وَالْوَاقِعِ فِيهَا وَالْمُدَاهِنِ فِيهَا كَمَثَلِ قَوْمٍ رَكِبُوا سَفِينَةً فَأَصَابَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَسْفَلَهَا وَأَوْعَرَهَا وَشَرَّهَا وَأَصَابَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَعْلَاهَا فَكَانَ الَّذِينَ فِي أَسْفَلِهَا إِذَا اسْتَقَوُا الْمَاءَ مَرُّوا عَلَى مَنْ فَوقَهُمْ فَآذُوْهُمْ فَقَالُوا: لَوْ خَرَقْنَا فِي نَصِيبِنَا خَرْقًا فَاسْتَقَيْنَا مِنْهُ وَلَمْ نُؤْذِ مَنْ فَوْقَنَا: فَإِنْ تَرَكُوهُمْ وَأَمْرَهُمْ هَلَكُوا جَمِيعًا وَإِنْ أَخَذُوا عَلَى أَيْدِيهِمْ نَجَوْا جَمِيعًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The parable of the person abiding by Allah's order and restrictions in comparison to those who violate them, or sit idle while they are being violated, is that of those who drew lots for their seats in a boat. Some of them got seats in the lower part, which is the most rough and worst part, and the others in the upper. When the former needed water, they had to go up to bring water and that troubled the others, so they said, 'Let us make a hole in our share of the ship and get water, saving those who are above us from troubling them, so, if the people in the upper part let the others do what they suggested, all the people of the ship would be destroyed, but if they prevented them, both parties would be safe.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This was recorded by Al-Bukhari, but not Muslim, in the Book of Partnerships and the Book of Witnesses. It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi through a different route of narration.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Umm Salamah, the Prophet's wife, said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا ظَهَرَتِ الْمَعَاصِي فِي أُمَّتِي عَمَّهُمُ اللهُ بِعَذَابٍ مِنْ عِنْدِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If sins become apparent in my Ummah, Allah will surround them with punishment from Him.)</span> I said, 'O Allah's Messenger! Will they have righteous people among them then?' He said,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">بَلَى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yes.)</span> I asked, 'What will happen to them?' He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُصِيبُهُمْ مَا أَصَابَ النَّاسَ ثُمَّ يَصِيرُونَ إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِنَ اللهِ وَرِضْوَانٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They will be striken as the people, but they will end up with Allah's forgiveness and pleasure.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Jarir said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا مِنْ قَوْمٍ يُعْمَلُ فِيهِمْ بِالْمَعَاصِي هُمْ أَعَزُّ وَأَكْثَرُ مِمَّنْ يَعْمَلُونَ ثُمَّ لَمْ يُغَيِّرُوهُ إِلَّا عَمَّهُمُ اللهُ بِعِقَابٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Every people among whom sins are being committed, while they are mightier and more numerous than those who do wrong, yet they did nothing to stop them, then Allah will surround them all with punishment.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Majah collected this Hadith.</p>"

They were few and He made them many, weak and fearful and He provided them with strength and victory. They were meek and poor, and He granted them sustenance and livelihood. He ordered them to be grateful to Him, and they obeyed Him and implemented what He commanded.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When the believers were still in Makkah they were few, practicing their religion in secret, oppressed, fearing that pagans, fire worshippers or Romans might kidnap them from the various parts of Allah's earth, for they were all enemies of the Muslims, especially since Muslims were few and weak. Later on, Allah permitted the believers to migrate to Al-Madinah, where He allowed them to settle in a safe resort. Allah made the people of Al-Madinah their allies, giving them refuge and support during Badr and other battles. They helped the Migrants with their wealth and gave up their lives in obedience of Allah and His Messenger ﷺ. Qatadah bin Di'amah As-Sadusi commented,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاذْكُرُوا إِذْ أَنتُمْ قَلِيلٌ مُّسْتَضْعَفُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And remember when you were few and were reckoned weak in the land,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"Arabs were the weakest of the weak, had the toughest life, the emptiest stomachs, the barest skin and the most obvious misguidance. Those who lived among them lived in misery; those who died went to the Fire. They were being eaten up, but unable to eat up others! By Allah! We do not know of a people on the face of the earth at that time who had a worse life than them. When Allah brought Islam, He made it dominant on the earth, thus bringing provisions and leadership for them over the necks of people. It is through Islam that Allah granted all what you see, so thank Him for His favors, for your Lord is One Who bestows favors and likes praise. Verily, those who thank Allah enjoy even more bounties from Him.\"</p>"
