    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them. And when they stand up for Salah, they stand with laziness and to be seen of men, and they do not remember Allah but little <span>(142)</span><span class=\"gray\">(They are)</span> swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those; and he whom Allah sends astray, you will not find for him a way <span>(143)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Hypocrites Try to Deceive Allah and Sway Between Believers and Disbelievers</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah <span class=\"gray\">[2]</span>, we mentioned Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُخَادِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They <span class=\"gray\">(think to)</span> deceive Allah and those who believe)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:9]</span>. Here, Allah states,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ يُخَادِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَهُوَ خَادِعُهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There is no doubt that Allah can never be deceived, for He has perfect knowledge of the secrets and what the hearts conceal. However, the hypocrites, due to their ignorance, scarce knowledge and weak minds, think that since they were successful in deceiving people, using Islamic Law as a cover of safety for themselves, they will acquire the same status with Allah on the Day of Resurrection and deceive Him too. Allah states that on that Day, the hypocrites will swear to Him that they were on the path of righteousness and correctness thinking that such statement will benefit them with Allah. For instance, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ اللَّهُ جَمِيعًا فَيَحْلِفُونَ لَهُ كَمَا يَحْلِفُونَ لَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together; then they will swear to Him as they swear to you)</span> Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَهُوَ خَادِعُهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but it is He Who deceives them)</span> means, He lures them further into injustice and misguidance. He also prevents them from reaching the truth in this life and on the Day of Resurrection. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَقُولُ الْمُنَافِقُونَ وَالْمُنَافِقَاتُ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا انظُرُونَا نَقْتَبِسْ مِن نُّورِكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day when the hypocrites ـ men and women ـ will say to the believers: \"Wait for us! Let us get something from your light!\" It will be said: \"Go back to your rear! Then seek a light!\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[57:13]</span> until,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And worst indeed is that destination)</span><span class=\"gray\">[57:15]</span>. A Hadith states;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَن سَمَّعَ سَمَّعَ اللهُ بِهِ، وَمَنْ رَاءَى رَاءَى اللهُ بِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever wants to be heard of, Allah will make him heard of, and whoever wants to be seen, Allah will show him.)</span> Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا قَامُوا إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ قَامُوا كُسَالَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when they stand up for Salah, they stand with laziness)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the characteristic of the hypocrites with the most honored, best and righteous act of worship, the prayer. When they stand for prayer, they stand in laziness because they neither truly intend to perform it nor do they believe in it, have humility in it, or understand it. This is the description of their outward attitude! As for their hearts, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُرَاءُونَ النَّاسَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(to be seen of men)</span> meaning, they do not have sincerity when worshipping Allah. Rather, they show off to people so that they gain closeness to them. They are often absent from the prayers that they can hide away from, such as the 'Isha' prayer and the Dawn prayer that are prayed in darkness. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَثْقَلُ الصَّلَاةِ عَلَى الْمُنَافِقِينَ صَلَاةُ الْعِشَاءِ وَصَلَاةُ الْفَجْرِ، وَلَوْ يَعْلَمُونَ مَا فِيهِمَا لَأَتَوْهُمَا وَلَوْ حَبْوًا، وَلَقَدْ هَمَمْتُ أَنْ آمُرَ بِالصَّلَاةِ فَتُقَامُ، ثُمَّ آمُرَ رَجُلًا فَيُصَلِّي بِالنَّاسِ، ثُمَّ أَنْطَلِقَ مَعِيَ بِرِجَالٍ مَعَهُمْ حُزَمٌ مِنْ حَطَبٍ، إِلى قَوْمٍ لَا يَشْهَدُونَ الصَّلَاةَ، فَأُحَرِّقَ عَلَيْهِمْ بُيُوتَهُمْ بِالنَّارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The heaviest prayers on the hypocrites are the 'Isha' and Dawn prayers. If they know their rewards, they will attend them even if they have to crawl. I was about to order someone to pronounce the Adhan for the prayer, then order someone to lead the prayer for the people, then order some men to collect fire-wood <span class=\"gray\">(fuel)</span>; then I would burn the houses around men who did not attend the <span class=\"gray\">(compulsory congregational)</span> prayer.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In another narration, the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَوْ عَلِمَ أَحَدُهُمْ أَنَّهُ يَجِدُ عَرْقًا سَمِينًا أَوْ مِرْمَاتَيْنِ حَسَنَتَيْنِ، لَشَهِدَ الصَّلَاةَ، وَلَوْلَا مَا فِي الْبُيُوتِ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ وَالذُّرِّيَّـةِ لَحَرَّقْتُ عَلَيْهِمْ بُيُوتَهُمْ بِالنَّارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By Him, in Whose Hand my soul is, if anyone of them had known that he would get a bone covered with good meat or two <span class=\"gray\">(small)</span> pieces of meat between two ribs, he would have turned up for the prayer, and had it not been that the houses have women and children in them, I would burn their homes around them.)</span> Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا يَذْكُرُونَ اللَّهَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they do not remember Allah but little)</span> means, during the prayer they do not feel humbleness or pay attention to what they are reciting. Rather, during their prayer, they are inattentive, jesting and avoid the good that they are meant to receive from prayer.</p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">Imam Malik reported that Al-'Ala' bin 'Abdur-Rahman said that Anas bin Malik said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">تِلْكَ صَلَاةُ الْمُنَافِقِ، تِلْكَ صَلَاةُ الْمُنَافِقِ، تِلْكَ صَلَاةُ الْمُنَافِقِ، يَجْلِسُ يَرْقُبُ الشَّمْسَ، حَتَّى إِذَا كَانَتْ بَيْنَ قَرْنَيِ الشَّيْطَانِ، قَامَ فَنَقَرَ أَرْبَعًا، لَا يَذْكُرُ اللهَ فِيهَا إِلَّا قَلِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(This is the prayer of the hypocrite, this is the prayer of the hypocrite, this is the prayer of the hypocrite. He sits watching the sun until when it goes down between the two horns of the devil, he stands up pecks out four Rak'ahs <span class=\"gray\">(for 'Asr)</span> without remembering Allah during them except little.)</span> Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded it. At-Tirmidhi said \"Hasan Sahih\".</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مُّذَبْذَبِينَ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ لَا إِلَىٰ هَٰؤُلَاءِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(They are)</span> swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these)</span> means that the hypocrites are swaying between faith and disbelief. So they are neither with believers inwardly or outwardly nor with disbelievers inwardly or outwardly. Rather, they are with the believers outwardly and with the disbelievers inwardly. Some of them would suffer fits of doubt, leaning towards these sometimes and towards those sometimes,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلَّمَا أَضَاءَ لَهُم مَّشَوْا فِيهِ وَإِذَا أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein, and when darkness covers them, they stand still)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:20]</span>. Mujahid said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مُّذَبْذَبِينَ بَيْنَ ذَٰلِكَ لَا إِلَىٰ هَٰؤُلَاءِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(They are)</span> swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these)</span> \"The Companions of Muhammad ﷺ,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا إِلَىٰ هَٰؤُلَاءِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(nor to those)</span>: the Jews.\" Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn 'Umar said that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَثَلُ الْمُنَافِقِ كَمَثَلِ الشَّاةِ الْعَائِرَةِ بَيْنَ الْغَنَمَيْنِ، تَعِيرُ إِلى هَذِهِ مَرَّةً، وَإِلَى هَذِهِ مَرَّةً، وَلَا تَدْرِي أَيَّتَهُمَا تَتْبَعُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The example of the hypocrite is the example of the sheep wandering between two herds, sometimes she goes to one of them, and sometimes the other, confused over whom she should follow.)</span> Muslim also recorded it. This is why Allah said afterwards,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ سَبِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and he whom Allah sends astray, you will not find for him a way.)</span> meaning, whomever He leads astray from the guidance,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ وَلِيًّا مُّرْشِدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(For him you will find no Wali <span class=\"gray\">(guiding friend)</span> to lead him <span class=\"gray\">(to the right path)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">[18:17]</span> because,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلاَ هَادِيَ لَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whomsoever Allah sends astray, none can guide him)</span>. So the hypocrites whom Allah has led astray from the paths of safety will never find a guide to direct them, nor someone to save them. There is none who can resist Allah's decision, and He is not asked about what He does, while they all will be asked.</p>"
