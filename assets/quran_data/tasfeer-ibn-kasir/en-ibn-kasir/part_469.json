    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And <span class=\"gray\">(remember)</span> when you killed a man and disagreed among yourselves as to the crime. But Allah brought forth that which you were Taktumun <span>(72)</span>So We said: \"Strike him <span class=\"gray\">(the dead man)</span> with a piece of it <span class=\"gray\">(the cow)</span>.\" Thus Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His Ayat <span class=\"gray\">(proofs, evidences, etc.)</span> so that you may understand <span>(73)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Bringing the murdered Man back to Life</h2></div><p lang=\"bg-Latn\" class=\"bg-Latn \">Al-Bukhari said that,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">فَادَّارَأْتُمْ فِيهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And disagreed among yourselves as to the crime)</span> means, \"Disputed.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is also the Tafsir of Mujahid. 'Ata' Al-Khurasani and Ad-Dahhak said, \"Disputed about this matter.\" Also, Ibn Jurayj said that,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذْ قَتَلْتُمْ نَفْسًا فَادَّارَأْتُمْ فِيهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And <span class=\"gray\">(remember)</span> when you killed a man and disagreed among yourselves as to the crime)</span> means, some of them said, \"You killed him,\" while the others said, \"No you killed him.\" This is also the Tafsir of 'Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. Mujahid said that,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">وَاللَّهُ مُخْرِجٌ مَّا كُنتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But Allah brought forth that which you were Taktumun)</span> means, \"what you were hiding.\"</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَقُلْنَا اضْرِبُوهُ بِبَعْضِهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So We said: \"Strike him <span class=\"gray\">(the dead man)</span> with a piece of it <span class=\"gray\">(the cow)</span>\")</span> meaning, \"any part of the cow will produce the miracle <span class=\"gray\">(if they struck the dead man with it)</span>.\" We were not told which part of the cow they used, as this matter does not benefit us either in matters of life or religion. Otherwise, Allah would have made it clear for us. Instead, Allah made this matter vague, so this is why we should leave it vague. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَذَٰلِكَ يُحْيِي اللَّهُ الْمَوْتَىٰ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Thus Allah brings the dead to life)</span> means, \"They struck him with it, and he came back to life.\" This Ayah demonstrates Allah's ability in bringing the dead back to life. Allah made this incident proof against the Jews that the Resurrection shall occur, and ended their disputing and stubbornness over the dead person.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah mentioned His bringing the dead back to life in five instances in Surat Al-Baqarah. First Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَاكُم مِّن بَعْدِ مَوْتِكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then We raised you up after your death)</span>. He then mentioned the story about the cow. Allah also mentioned the story of those who escaped death in their land, while they were numbering in the thousands. He also mentioned the story of the Prophet who passed by a village that was destroyed, the story of Abraham and the four birds, and the land that comes back to life after it has died. All these incidents and stories alert us to the fact that bodies shall again become whole, after they were rotten. The proof of Resurrection is also reiterated in Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَآيَةٌ لَّهُمُ الْأَرْضُ الْمَيْتَةُ أَحْيَيْنَاهَا وَأَخْرَجْنَا مِنْهَا حَبًّا فَمِنْهُ يَأْكُلُونَ - وَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا جَنَّاتٍ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَابٍ وَفَجَّرْنَا فِيهَا مِنَ الْعُيُونِ - لِيَأْكُلُوا مِن ثَمَرِهِ وَمَا عَمِلَتْهُ أَيْدِيهِمْ أَفَلَا يَشْكُرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And a sign for them is the dead land. We give it life, and We bring forth from it grains, so that they eat thereof. And We have made therein gardens of date palms and grapes, and We have caused springs of water to gush forth therein. So that they may eat of the fruit thereof ـ and their hands made it not. Will they not then give thanks?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(36:33-35)</span>.</p>"
