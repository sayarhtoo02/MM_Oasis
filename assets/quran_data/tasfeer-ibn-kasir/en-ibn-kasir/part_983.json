They say: \"Shall we indeed be brought back from Al-Hafirah?\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(11. \"Even after we are bones Nakhirah?\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(12. They say: \"It would in that case, be a return with loss!\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(13. But it will be only a single Zajrah.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(14. When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Swearing by Five Characteristics that the Day of Judgement will occur</p><p lang=\"ha\" class=\"ha \">Ibn Mas'ud, Ibn 'Abbas, Masruq, Sa'id bin Jubayr, Abu Salih, Abu Ad-Duha and As-Suddi all said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالنَّازِعَاتِ غَرْقًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By those who pull out, drowning.)</span> \"These are the angels who remove the souls from the Children of Adam.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Among them are those whose souls are removed by the angels with difficulty, as if he is being drowned during its removal. There are those people whose souls the angels remove with ease, as if they were unraveling him <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., his soul from him)</span> due to their briskness. This is the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالنَّاشِطَاتِ نَشْطًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By those who free briskly.)</span> This has been mentioned by Ibn 'Abbas. In reference to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالسَّابِحَاتِ سَبْحًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And by the swimmers, swimming.)</span> Ibn Mas'ud said, \"They are the angels.\" Similar statements have been reported from 'Ali, Mujahid, Sa'id bin Jubayr, and Abu Salih. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">فَالسَّابِقَاتِ سَبْقًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And by the racers, racing.)</span> It has been narrated from 'Ali, Masruq, Mujahid, Abu Salih, and Al-Hasan Al-Basri that this means the angels. Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">فَالْمُدَبِّرَاتِ أَمْرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And by those who arrange affairs.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ali, Mujahid, 'Ata', Abu Salih, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi' bin Anas, and As-Suddi all said, \"They are the angels.\" Al-Hasan added, \"They control the affairs from the heaven to the earth, meaning by the command of their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Description of the Day of Judgement, the People, and what They will say</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الرَّاجِفَةُ - تَتْبَعُهَا الرَّادِفَةُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day the Rajifah shakes, followed by the Radifah.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas said, \"These are the two blasts <span class=\"gray\">(of the Trumpet)</span> – the first and the second.\" Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others have made similar statements. It has been reported from Mujahid that he said, \"In reference to the first, it is the statement of Allah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الرَّاجِفَةُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day the Rajifah shakes,)</span> This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الْأَرْضُ وَالْجِبَالُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day the earth and the mountains shake.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(73:14)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The second is Ar-Radifah, and it is like the Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَحُمِلَتِ الْأَرْضُ وَالْجِبَالُ فَدُكَّتَا دَكَّةً وَاحِدَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the earth and mountains shall be removed from their places, and crushed with a single crushing.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(69:14)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلُوبٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَاجِفَةٌ</p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \"><span class=\"gray\">(Hearts that Day will tremble.)</span> Ibn 'Abbas said, \"This means afraid.\" Mujahid and Qatadah also said this.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">أَبْصَارُهَا خَاشِعَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Their vision humiliated.)</span> meaning, the eyes of the people. It means that the eyes will be lowly and disgraced from what they will witness of terrors. Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَقُولُونَ أَإِنَّا لَمَرْدُودُونَ فِي الْحَافِرَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They say: \"Shall we indeed be brought back from Al-Hafirah?\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, the idolators of the Quraysh and whoever rejects the Hereafter as they did. They consider the occurrence of the resurrection after being placed in Al-Hafirah – which are the graves – as something farfetched. This has been said by Mujahid. They feel that this is something impossible after the destruction of their physical bodies and the disintegration of their bones and their decaying. Thus, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَإِذَا كُنَّا عِظَامًا نَّخِرَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Even after we are bones Nakhirah?)</span> It has also been recited:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">(نَاخِرَةً)</p><p lang=\"lv\" class=\"lv \"><span class=\"gray\">(Nākhirah)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah, all said, \"This means decayed.\" Ibn 'Abbas said, \"It is the bone when it has decayed and air enters into it.\" Concerning their saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> تِلْكَ إِذًا كَرَّةٌ خَاسِرَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It would in that case be a return with loss.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(79:12)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Muhammad bin Ka'b said that the Quraysh said, \"If Allah brings us back to life after we die, then surely we will be losers.\" Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِنَّمَا هِيَ زَجْرَةٌ وَاحِدَةٌ - فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But it will be only a single Zajrah. When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, this is a matter that is from Allah that will not occur twice, nor will there be any opportunity to affirm it or verify it. The people will be standing and looking. This will be when Allah commands the angel Israfil to blow into the Sur, which will be the blowing of the resurrection. At that time the first people and the last people will all be standing before their Lord looking. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praise and obedience, and you will think that you have stayed but a little while!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:52)</span></p><p lang=\"gl\" class=\"gl \">Allah has also said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا أَمْرُنَا إِلَّا وَاحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(54:50)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah also says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَمَا أَمْرُ السَّاعَةِ إِلَّا كَلَمْحِ الْبَصَرِ أَوْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the matter of the Hour is not but as a twinkling of the eye, or even nearer.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(16:77)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.)</span> Ibn 'Abbas said, \"As-Sahirah means the entire earth.\" Sa'id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and Abu Salih have all said this as well. 'Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Zayd have all said, \"As-Sahirah means the face of the earth.\" Mujahid said, \"They will be at its <span class=\"gray\">(the earth's)</span> lowest part, and they will be brought out to highest part.\" Then he said, \"As-Sahirah is a level place.\"</p><p lang=\"ha\" class=\"ha \">Ar-Rabi' bin Anas said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.)</span></p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">\"Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الْأَرْضُ غَيْرَ الْأَرْضِ وَالسَّمَاوَاتُ ۖ وَبَرَزُوا لِلَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(14:48)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">and He says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّي نَسْفًا - فَيَذَرُهَا قَاعًا صَفْصَفًا - لَّا تَرَىٰ فِيهَا عِوَجًا وَلَا أَمْتًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they ask you concerning the mountains, say: \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust. Then He shall leave them as a level smooth plain. You will see therein nothing crooked or curved.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(20:105-107)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">and Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الْأَرْضَ بَارِزَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away, and you will see the earth as a leveled plain.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(18:47)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">and the earth will be brought forth which will have mountains upon it, and it will not be considered from this earth <span class=\"gray\">(of this life)</span>. It will be an earth that no sin will be performed on it, nor will any blood be shed upon it.\"</p>"
