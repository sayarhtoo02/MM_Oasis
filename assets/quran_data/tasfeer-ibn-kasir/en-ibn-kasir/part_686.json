Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيْلٌ لِكُلِّ أَفَّاكٍ أَثِيمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Woe to every sinful liar.)</span> who lies in his speech, often swears, who is worthless, commits and utters sinful acts and statements, and disbelieves in Allah's Ayat,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَسْمَعُ آيَاتِ اللَّهِ تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who hears the Ayat of Allah Tutla <span class=\"gray\">(recited)</span> to him,)</span> meaning, being recited to him,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">ثُمَّ يُصِرُّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(yet persists)</span> in his disbelief, denial, pride and rebellion,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَأَنْ لَمْ يَسْمَعْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(as if he heard them not.)</span> as if he did not hear them being recited to him,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَبَشِّرْهُ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So announce to him a painful torment!)</span> convey the news to him that on the Day of Resurrection, he will have a painful, severe torment from Allah.

And who is more astray than those who invoke besides Allah others who will not answer them until the Day of Resurrection, and who are unaware of their invocations to them?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6. And when mankind are gathered, they <span class=\"gray\">(false deities)</span> will become their enemies and will deny their worship.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Qur'an is a Revelation from Allah and the Universe is His True Creation</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah informs that He has revealed the Book to His servant and Messenger Muhammad – may Allah's blessings be upon him until the Day of Judgement. Allah then describes Himself as being of unimaginable glory, possessing ultimate wisdom in His statements and actions. Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except in truth,)</span> meaning, not in idle play and falsehood.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَجَلٍ مُسَمًّى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and for a specified term.)</span> meaning, for a fixed and specified duration that will not increase or decrease.

Allah has indeed revealed to them a Book and sent to them a Messenger. Yet, they obstinately turn away from all of that. Therefore, they will soon realize the consequence of their behavior.</p><p lang=\"sn\" class=\"sn \">Refuting the Idolators</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah then says,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">قُلْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say)</span> meaning, to these idolators who worship others besides Allah.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَرَأَيْتُمْ مَا تَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ أَرُونِي مَاذَا خَلَقُوا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Think you about all that you invoke besides Allah?

They do not own even the thin membrane covering a date's pit. The dominion and control only belong to Allah, Exalted is He. 'How then would you worship others or join them as partners with Him? Who guided you to that? Who called you to that? Did He command you to do it, or is it something that you suggested yourselves?' Thus, He says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ائْتُونِي بِكِتَابٍ مِنْ قَبْلِ هَٰذَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Bring me a scripture prior to this)</span> meaning, 'bring a book from among the Books of Allah that have been revealed to the Prophets, that commands you to worship these idols.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوْ أَثَارَةٍ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(or some trace of knowledge,)</span> meaning, 'some clear evidence justifying this way you have chosen.'</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(if you are truthful!)</span> meaning, 'you have absolutely no evidence for that – neither textual <span class=\"gray\">(from revelation)</span> nor rational.' For this reason, some recited it;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوْ أَثَرَةٍ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"or something inherited from knowledge\" meaning, 'or true knowledge that you have inherited from anyone before you.' This is similar to Mujahid's statement when he said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> أَوْ أَثَارَةٍ مِنْ عِلْمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(or some trace of knowledge.)</span> \"Or anyone who has inherited any knowledge.\" Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّنْ يَدْعُو مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مَنْ لَا يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ وَهُمْ عَنْ دُعَائِهِمْ غَافِلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And who is more astray than those who invokes besides Allah others who will not answer them until the Day of Resurrection, and who are unaware of their invocations to them?)</span> meaning, no one is more misguided than those who invoke idols instead of Allah, asking them for things that they cannot give – until the Day of Judgment. They <span class=\"gray\">(the idols)</span> are unaware of what he asks, they can neither hear, see, or act. This is because they are inanimate, senseless stones. Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُوا لَهُمْ أَعْدَاءً وَكَانُوا بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَافِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worship.)</span> This is similar to Allah's saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاتَّخَذُوا مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ آلِهَةً لِيَكُونُوا لَهُمْ عِزًّا - كَلَّا ۚ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They have taken gods beside Allah, that they might give them dignity. No! They will deny their worship of them, and will be opponents to them.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(19:81-82)</span> meaning, they will betray them when they need them the most. <span class=\"gray\">(Ibrahim)</span> Al-Khalil, peace be upon him, said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَانًا مَوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضًا وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِنْ نَاصِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(You have taken only idols besides Allah! The love between you is only in the life of this world. On the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helpers.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(29:25)</span></p>"
