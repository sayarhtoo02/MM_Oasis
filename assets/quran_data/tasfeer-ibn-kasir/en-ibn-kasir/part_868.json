Then whoever transgresses thereafter, for him there is a painful torment <span>(94)</span>O you who believe! Kill not game while you are in a state of Ihram, and whosoever of you kills it intentionally, the penalty is an offering, brought to the Ka'bah, of livestock equivalent to the one he killed, as adjudged by two just men among you; or, for expiation, he should feed the poor, or its equivalent in fasting, that he may taste the heaviness <span class=\"gray\">(punishment)</span> of his deed.

And Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution <span>(95)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Prohibiting Hunting Game in the Sacred Area and During the State of Ihram</h2></div><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">Ali bin Abi Talhah] Al-Walibi said that Ibn 'Abbas said that Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيَبْلُوَنَّكُمُ اللَّهُ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنَ الصَّيْدِ تَنَالُهُ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَرِمَاحُكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah will certainly make a trial for you with something in <span class=\"gray\">(the matter of)</span> the game that is well within reach of your hands and your lances,)</span><span class=\"gray\">[5:94]</span>, refers to, \"The weak and young game. Allah tests His servants with such game during their Ihram, that if they wish, they would be able to catch it with their hands. Allah has commanded them to avoid catching it.\" Mujahid said that,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">تَنَالُهُ أَيْدِيكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(well within reach of your hands)</span> refers to the young game and chicks, while</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَرِمَاحُكُمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and your lances,)</span> refers to mature game. Muqatil bin Hayyan said that this Ayah was revealed during the 'Umrah of Al-Hudaybiyyah, when wild game and birds were coming to the Muslim camping area, which they had never seen the likes of before. Allah prohibited them from hunting the game while in the state of Ihram,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِيَعْلَمَ اللَّهُ مَن يَخَافُهُ بِالْغَيْبِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that Allah may test who fears Him in the unseen.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, Allah tests His servants with the game that comes near their camping area, for if they wish, they can catch it with their hands and spears in public and secret. This is how the obedience of those who obey Allah in public and secret becomes apparent and tested. In another Ayah, Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُم بِالْغَيْبِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَأَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily! Those who fear their Lord in the unseen, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. Paradise)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[67:12]</span> Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمَنِ اعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then whoever transgresses thereafter.)</span> after this warning and threat, according to As-Suddi, then,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(for him there is a painful torment.)</span> for his defiance of Allah's command and what He has decreed. Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَقْتُلُوا الصَّيْدَ وَأَنتُمْ حُرُمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe! Kill not game while you are in a state of Ihram,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Ayah prohibits killing the game in the state of Ihram, except what is exempt from this as mentioned in the Two Sahihs; 'A'ishah narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خَمْسٌ فَوَاسِقُ يُقْتَلْنَ فِي الْحِلِّ وَالْحَرَمِ: الْغُرَابُ، وَالْحِدَأَةُ، وَالْعَقْرَبُ، وَالْفَأْرَةُ، وَالْكَلْبُ الْعَقُورُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Five are Fawasiq, they may be killed while in Ihram or not; the crow, the kite, the scorpion, the mouse and the rabid dog.)</span> Ibn 'Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خَمْسٌ مِنَ الدَّوَابِّ لَيْسَ عَلَى الْمُحْرِمِ فِي قَتْلِهِنَّ جُنَاحٌ: الْغُرَابُ، وَالْحِدَأَةُ، وَالْعَقْرَبُ، وَالْفَأْرَةُ، وَالْكَلْبُ الْعَقُورُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is not harmful in a state of Ihram to kill five kinds of animals: the crow, the kite, the scorpion, the mouse and the rabid dog.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. Ayyub narrated that Nafi' narrated similar wordings for this Hadith from Ibn 'Umar. Ayyub said, \"So I said to Nafi', 'What about the snake' He said, 'There is no doubt that killing the snake is allowed.'\" The ruling concerning the rabid dog also includes the wolf, lion, leopard, tiger and their like, since they are more dangerous than the rabid dog, or because the term Kalb <span class=\"gray\">(dog)</span> covers them. Allah knows best.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abu Sa'id narrated that the Prophet ﷺ was asked about the animals that the Muhrim is allowed to kill and he said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الحَيَّةُ، وَالْعَقْرَبُ، وَالْفُوَيسِقَةُ، وَيَرْمِي الْغُرَابَ وَلَا يُقْتُلُهُ، وَالْكَلْبُ الْعَقُورُ، وَالحِدَأَةُ، وَالسَّبُعُ العَادِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The snake, the scorpion, the mouse, and the crow - which is shot at but not killed – the rabid dog, the kite and wild beasts of prey.)</span> Abu Dawud recorded this Hadith, as did At-Tirmidhi, who said, \"Hasan\", and Ibn Majah.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Penalty of Killing Game in the Sacred Area or in the State of Ihram</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن قَتَلَهُ مِنكُم مُّتَعَمِّدًا فَجَزَاءٌ مِّثْلُ مَا قَتَلَ مِنَ النَّعَمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whosoever of you kills it intentionally, the penalty is <span class=\"gray\">[an offering of]</span> livestock equivalent to the one he killed.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Mujahid bin Jabr said, \"The meaning of 'intentionally' here is that one intends to kill the game while forgetting that he is in the state of Ihram. Whoever intentionally kills the game while aware that he is in the state of Ihram, then this offense is more grave than to make an expiation, and he also loses his Ihram.\" This statement is odd, and the view of majority is that they have to pay the expiation for killing the game whether they forgot that they are in Ihram or not. Az-Zuhri said, \"The Book <span class=\"gray\">(the Qur'an)</span> asserts the expiation for intentional killing, and the Sunnah included those who forget, as well.\" The meaning of this statement is that the Qur'an mentioned the expiation and sin of those who intentionally kill game,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِّيَذُوقَ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِ عَفَا اللَّهُ عَمَّا سَلَفَ وَمَنْ عَادَ فَيَنتَقِمُ اللَّهُ مِنْهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that he may taste the heaviness <span class=\"gray\">(punishment)</span> of his deed. Allah has forgiven what is past, but whosoever commits it again, Allah will take retribution from him.)</span> the Sunnah that includes the rulings issued by the Prophet ﷺ and his Companions, indicated the necessity of expiation in cases of unintentional killing of game, just as the Book legislated expiation for intentional killing. Killing game is a form of waste, which requires expiation in intentional and unintentional cases, although those who intend it have sinned, rather than those who made an honest error. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَجَزَاءٌ مِّثْلُ مَا قَتَلَ مِنَ النَّعَمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The penalty is <span class=\"gray\">[an offering of]</span> livestock equivalent to the one he killed.)</span> indicates the necessity of offering an equivalent animal to the one the Muhrim killed. The Companions gave rulings that the camel, for instance, is the equivalent of the ostrich, the cow is the equivalent of wild cattle, and the goat for the deer. As for the cases when there is no equivalent for the killed animal, Ibn 'Abbas said that one should spend its amount in Makkah <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. charity)</span>, as Al-Bayhaqi recorded. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> يَحْكُمُ بِهِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(As adjudged by two just men among you;)</span> means, two just Muslim men should determine an animal equivalent to the game killed, or the amount of its price. Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Jarir Al-Bajali said, \"I killed a deer when I was in the state of Ihram and mentioned this fact to 'Umar, who said, 'Bring two of your brethren and let them judge you.' So I went to 'Abdur-Rahman and Sa'd and they said that I should offer a male sheep.\" Ibn Jarir recorded that Tariq said, \"Arbad killed a deer while in the state of Ihram and he went to 'Umar to judge him. 'Umar said to him, 'Let us both judge,' and they judged that Arbad should offer a goat that was fed on abundant water and grass. 'Umar commented,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> يَحْكُمُ بِهِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(As adjudged by two just men among you;)</span>.\" Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَدْيًا بَالِغَ الْكَعْبَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...an offering brought to the Ka'bah.)</span> indicates that this equivalent animal should be brought to the Ka'bah, meaning, the Sacred Area, where it should be slaughtered and its meat divided between the poor of the Sacred Area. There is a consensus on this ruling. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوْ كَفَّارَةٌ طَعَامُ مَسَاكِينَ أَوْ عَدْلُ ذَٰلِكَ صِيَامًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(or, for expiation, he should feed the poor, or its equivalent in fasting,)</span> that is, if the Muhrim does not find an equivalent to what he killed, or the animal hunted is not comparable to anything else. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">'Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn 'Abbas commented on the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَدْيًا بَالِغَ الْكَعْبَةِ أَوْ كَفَّارَةٌ طَعَامُ مَسَاكِينَ أَوْ عَدْلُ ذَٰلِكَ صِيَامًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...an offering brought to the Ka'bah, or, for expiation, he should feed the poor, or its equivalent in fasting.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"If the Muhrim killed game, then his judgement is its equivalent. If he kills an antelope, he offers a sheep slaughtered in Makkah. If he cannot, then he feeds six poor people, otherwise he should fast for three days. If he kills a deer, he offers a cow. If unable, he feeds twenty poor people, or otherwise if unable, he fasts for twenty days. If he kills an ostrich or zebra, he offers a camel, or he feeds thirty poor people, or fasts thirty days.\" Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir recorded this statement, and in Ibn Jarir's narration, the food measurement is a Mudd <span class=\"gray\">(4 handfuls of food)</span> each that suffices for the poor. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">لِّيَذُوقَ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that he may taste the heaviness <span class=\"gray\">(punishment)</span> of his deed.)</span> means, We have required him to pay this expiation so that he tastes the punishment of his error,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَفَا اللَّهُ عَمَّا سَلَفَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah has forgiven what is past.)</span> during the time of Jahiliyyah, provided that one becomes good in Islam and follows Allah's Law, all the while avoiding the sin. Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ عَادَ فَيَنتَقِمُ اللَّهُ مِنْهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but whosoever commits it again, Allah will take retribution from him.)</span> meaning, whoever does this after it has been prohibited in Islam and having knowledge that it is prohibited,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَيَنتَقِمُ اللَّهُ مِنْهُ وَاللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah will take retribution from him. And Allah is Almighty, All-Able of retribution.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Jurayj said, \"I said to 'Ata', 'What is the meaning of,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَفَا اللَّهُ عَمَّا سَلَفَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah has forgiven what is past.)</span>?' He said, 'Meaning, during the time of Jahiliyyah.' I asked about,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ عَادَ فَيَنتَقِمُ اللَّهُ مِنْهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but whosoever commits it again, Allah will take retribution from him.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He said, 'Whoever commits this offense again in Islam, then Allah will take retribution from him and he also has to pay the expiation.' I asked, 'Is there any punishment for repeating this offense that you know of?' He said, 'No.' I said, 'Do you think that the authorities should punish him?' He said, 'No, for it is a sin that he committed between him and Allah. He should pay the expiation.'\" Ibn Jarir recorded this statement.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was said that the 'Allah will take retribution' refers to the expiation, according to Sa'id bin Jubayr, 'Ata', and the majority among the earlier and later generations. They stated that when the Muhrim kills game, the expiation becomes necessary, regardless of whether it was the first, second or third offense, and whether intentional or by error. Ibn Jarir commented on Allah's statement;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَاللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah is Almighty, All-Able of retribution.)</span> \"Allah says that He is invincible in His control, none can resist Him, prevent Him from exacting retribution from anyone, or stop Him from punishing anyone. This is because all creation is His creation and the decision is His, His is the might, and His is the control. His statement,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">ذُو انتِقَامٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(All-Able of retribution.)</span> meaning, He punishes those who disobey Him for their disobedience of Him.\"</p>"
