This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مِنَ اللَّهِ ذِي الْمَعَارِجِ - تَعْرُجُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ إِلَيْهِ فِي يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(From Allah, the Lord of the ways of ascent. The angels and the Ruh <span class=\"gray\">(Jibril)</span> ascend to Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(70:3-4)</span>. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">If Allah wills, we will discuss below which is the most correct view the distance between the Throne and the seventh earth according to a group of earlier and later scholars. More than one scholar said that the Throne is made of red rubies. The width between two corners of it is the distance of a fifty thousand year long journey and its height above the seventh earth is the distance of a fifty thousand years long journey.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُلْقِي الرُّوحَ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ عَلَىٰ مَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He sends the revelation of His command to any of His servants He wills,)</span> This is like the Ayat:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَائِكَةَ بِالرُّوحِ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ عَلَىٰ مَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ أَنْ أَنْذِرُوا أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاتَّقُونِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He sends down the angels with the Ruh <span class=\"gray\">(revelation)</span> of His command to whom of His servants He wills <span class=\"gray\">(saying)</span>: \"Warn mankind that none has the right to be worshipped but I, so have Taqwa of Me.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(16:2)</span>, and</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّهُ لَتَنْزِيلُ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ - نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الْأَمِينُ - عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ لِتَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُنْذِرِينَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And truly, this is a revelation from the Lord of all that exits, Which the trustworthy Ruh <span class=\"gray\">(Jibril)</span> has brought down Upon your heart that you may be <span class=\"gray\">(one)</span> of the warners.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(26:192-194)</span> Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> لِيُنْذِرَ يَوْمَ التَّلَاقِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that he may warn <span class=\"gray\">(men)</span> of the Day of Mutual Meeting.)</span> 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas said: \"The Day of Mutual Meeting is one of the names of the Day of Resurrection, of which Allah warns His servants.\" That is the Day when everyone will find out about his deeds, good and bad.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ هُمْ بَارِزُونَ ۖ لَا يَخْفَىٰ عَلَى اللَّهِ مِنْهُمْ شَيْءٌ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Day when they will come out, nothing of them will be hidden from Allah.)</span> means, they will all appear in the open, with nothing to give them shelter or shade, or cover them. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ هُمْ بَارِزُونَ ۖ لَا يَخْفَىٰ عَلَى اللَّهِ مِنْهُمْ شَيْءٌ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Day when they will come out, nothing of them will be hidden from Allah.)</span> meaning, everything will be equally known to Him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> لِمَنِ الْمُلْكُ الْيَوْمَ ۖ لِلَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whose is the kingdom this Day? It is Allah's, the One, the Irresistible!)</span> We have already mentioned the Hadith of Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah will roll up the heavens and the earth in His Hand and will say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنَا الْمَلِكُ، أَنَا الْجَبَّارُ، أَنَا الْمُتَكَبِّرُ، أَيْنَ مُلُوكُ الْأَرْضِ؟ أَيْنَ الْجَبَّارُونَ؟ أَيْنَ الْمُتَكَبِّرُونَ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"I am the King, I am the Compeller, I am the Proud, where are the kings of the earth? Where are the tyrants? Where are the proud?\")</span> In the Hadith about the Trumpet, it says that Allah will take the souls of all of His creatures, and there will be none left but Him Alone, with no partner or associate. Then He will say, \"Whose is the kingdom today?\" three times, and He will answer Himself by saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِلَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is Allah's, the One, the Irresistible!)</span> meaning, He is the Only One Who has subjugated all things.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْيَوْمَ تُجْزَىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ ۚ لَا ظُلْمَ الْيَوْمَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(This Day shall every person be recompensed for what he earned. This Day no injustice <span class=\"gray\">(shall be done to anybody)</span>. </span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Truly, Allah is swift in reckoning.) Here Allah tells us of His justice when He judges between His creation; He does not do even a speck of dust's weight of injustice, whether it be for good or for evil. For every good deed He gives a tenfold reward and for every bad deed He gives recompense of one bad deed. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا ظُلْمَ الْيَوْمَ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(This Day no injustice <span class=\"gray\">(shall be done to anybody)</span>.)</span> It was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا عِبَادِي إِنِّي حَرَّمْتُ الظُّلْمَ عَلىٰ نَفْسِي وَجَعَلْتُهُ بَيْنَكُمْ مُحَرَّمًا فَلَا تَظَالَمُوا - إلى أن قال - يَا عِبَادِي إِنَّمَا هِيَ أَعْمَالُكُمْ أُحْصِيهَا عَلَيْكُمْ ثُمَّ أُوَفِّيكُمْ إِيَّاهَا، فَمَنْ وَجَدَ خَيْرًا فَلْيَحْمَدِ اللهَ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَىٰ، وَمَنْ وَجَدَ غَيْرَ ذَلِكَ فَلَا يَلُومَنَّ إِلَّا نَفْسَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"O My servants, I have forbidden injustice for Myself, and made it unlawful for you, so do not commit injustice to one another ...\")</span> up to: <span class=\"gray\">(\"O My servants, these are your deeds, I record them for you then I will recompense you for them. Whoever finds something good, let him give praise to Allah, and whoever finds something other than that, let him blame no one but himself.\")</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Truly, Allah is swift in reckoning.)</span> means, He will bring all His creation to account as if He is bringing just one person to account. This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلَا بَعْثُكُمْ إِلَّا كَنَفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as a single person)</span><span class=\"gray\">(31: 28)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا أَمْرُنَا إِلَّا وَاحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(54:50)</span></p>"
