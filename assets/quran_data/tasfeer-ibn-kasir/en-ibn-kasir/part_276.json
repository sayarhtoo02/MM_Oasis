The Mothers of the believers are more entitled to be included in this category than any other chaste woman, especially the one who was the reason for this Ayah being revealed: 'A'ishah bint As-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with them both. All of the scholars agree that whoever slanders her or makes accusations against after what has been said in this Ayah, is a disbeliever, because of his being obstinate with the Qur'an. The same ruling applies to all of the Mothers of the believers.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لُعِنُوا فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter,)</span> This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger,)</span><span class=\"gray\">(33:57)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, \"This is about 'A'ishah, and whoever does anything similar nowadays to Muslim women, the same applies to him, but 'A'ishah is the one who is primarily referred to here.\"</p><p lang=\"jv\" class=\"jv \">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اجْتَنِبُوا السَّبْعَ الْمُوبِقَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Shun the seven destructive sins.)</span> He was asked, \"What are they, O Messenger of Allah?\" He said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الشِّرْكُ بِاللهِ، وَالسِّحْرُ، وَقَتْلُ النَّفْسِ الَّتِي حَرَّمَ اللهُ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ، وَأَكْلُ الرِّبَا، وَأَكْلُ مَالِ الْيَتِيمِ، وَالتَّوَلِّي يَوْمَ الزَّحْفِ، وَقَذْفُ الْمُحْصَنَاتِ الْغَافِلَاتِ الْمُؤْمِنَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Associating partners with Allah; magic; killing a soul whom Allah has forbidden to be killed, except with just cause; consuming Riba; consuming the property of orphans; desertion at the time of war; and accusing chaste women, who never even think of anything touching their chastity and are good believers.)</span> This was recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim in the Two Sahihs.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ تَشْهَدُ عَلَيْهِمْ أَلْسِنَتُهُمْ وَأَيْدِيهِمْ وَأَرْجُلُهُم بِمَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day when their tongues, their hands, and their legs will bear witness against them as to what they used to do.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"This refers to the idolators when they realize that no one will enter Paradise except the people who used to perform Salah. They will say, 'Come, let us deny <span class=\"gray\">(everything)</span>.' So they will deny <span class=\"gray\">(everything)</span>, then their mouths will be sealed and their hands and feet will testify against them, and they will not be able to hide anything from Allah.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"We were with the Prophet ﷺ and he smiled so broadly that his back teeth could be seen, then he said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَتَدْرُونَ مِمَّ أَضْحَكُ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do you know why I am smiling?)</span> We said, 'Allah and His Messenger know best.'

He will say, \"O Lord, did you not protect me from doing wrong?\" Allah will say, \"Of course,\" The person will say, \"I will not accept for anyone to give testimony concerning me except myself.\" Allah will say, \"You are sufficient as a witness against yourself.\" Then a seal will be put upon his mouth and it will be said to his faculties, \"Speak.\" So they will speak about his deeds. Then he will be permitted to speak, and he will say, \"Away with you!

This was revealed concerning 'A'ishah and the people of the slander.\" This was also narrated from Mujahid, 'Ata', Sa'id bin Jubayr, Ash-Sha'bi, Al-Hasan bin Abu Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Habib bin Abi Thabit and Ad-Dahhak, and it was also the view favored by Ibn Jarir. He interpreted it to mean that evil speech is more suited to evil people, and good speech is more suited to good people. What the hypocrites attributed to 'A'ishah was more suited to them, and she was most suited to innocence and having nothing to do with them. Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُولَٰئِكَ مُبَرَّءُونَ مِمَّا يَقُولُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(such <span class=\"gray\">(good people)</span> are innocent of <span class=\"gray\">(every)</span> bad statement which they say;)</span></p><p lang=\"ha\" class=\"ha \">Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, \"Evil women are for evil men and evil men are for evil women, and good women are for good men and good men are for good women.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This also necessarily refers back to what they said, i.e., Allah would not have made 'A'ishah the wife of His Messenger ﷺ unless she had been good, because he is the best of the best of mankind. If she had been evil, she would not have been a suitable partner either according to His Laws or His decree. Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُولَٰئِكَ مُبَرَّءُونَ مِمَّا يَقُولُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(such are innocent of <span class=\"gray\">(every)</span> bad statement which they say;)</span> meaning, they are remote from what the people of slander and enmity say.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(for them is forgiveness,)</span> means, because of the lies that were told about them,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and honored provision.)</span> meaning, with Allah in the Gardens of Delight. This implies a promise that she will be the wife of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in Paradise.</p>"
