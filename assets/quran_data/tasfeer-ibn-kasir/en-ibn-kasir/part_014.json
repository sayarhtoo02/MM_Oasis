    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Verily, the parable of the life of the world is as the water which We send down from the sky; so by it arises the intermingled produce of the earth of which men and cattle eat: until when the earth is clad in its adornments and is beautified, and its people think that they have all the powers of disposal over it, Our command reaches it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday! Thus do We explain the Ayat in detail for the people who reflect <span>(24)</span>Allah calls to the Abode of Peace <span class=\"gray\">(Paradise)</span> and guides whom He wills to the straight path <span>(25)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Parable of this Life</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah the Almighty has set an example of the similitude of the life of this world, its glitter and the swiftness of its passage, likening it to the plant and vegetation that Allah brings out from the earth. This plant grows from the water that comes down from the sky. These plants are food for people, such as fruits and other different types and kinds of foods. Some other kinds are food for cattle such as clover plants <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. green fodder for the cattle)</span> and herbage etc.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَتَّىٰ إِذَا أَخَذَتِ الْأَرْضُ زُخْرُفَهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(until when the earth is clad in its adornments ,)</span></p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَازَّيَّنَتْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and is beautified )</span> meaning, it became good by what grows on its hills such as blooming flowers of different shapes and colors.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَظَنَّ أَهْلُهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and its people think...)</span> those who planted it and put it in the ground,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">أَنَّهُمْ قَادِرُونَ عَلَيْهَا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that they have all the powers of disposal over it)</span> to cultivate it and harvest it. But while they were in that frame of mind, a thunderbolt or a severe, cold storm came to it. It dried its leaves and spoiled its fruits. Allah said:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">أَتَاهَا أَمْرُنَا لَيْلًا أَوْ نَهَارًا فَجَعَلْنَاهَا حَصِيدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Our command reaches it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest,)</span> it became dry after it was green and flourishing.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَأَن لَّمْ تَغْنَ بِالْأَمْسِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(as if it had not flourished yesterday!)</span> as if nothing existed there before. Qatadah said: \"As if it had not flourished; as if it was never blessed.\" Such are things after they perish, they are as if they had never existed. Similarly, the Hadith,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُؤْتَى بِأَنْعَمِ أَهْلِ الدُّنْيَا، فَيُغْمَسُ فِي النَّارِ غَمْسَةً، فَيُقَالُ لَهُ: هَلْ رَأَيْتَ خَيْرًا قَطُّ؟ هَلْ مَرَّ بِكَ نَعِيمٌ قَطُّ؟ فَيَقُولُ: لَا، وَيُؤْتَى بِأَشَدِّ النَّاسِ عَذَابًا فِي الدُّنْيَا، فَيُغْمَسُ فِي النَّعِيمِ غَمْسَةً، ثُمَّ يُقَالُ لَهُ: هَلْ رَأَيْتَ بُؤْسًا قَطُّ؟ فَيَقُولُ لَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(A person who led the most prosperous life in this world will be brought up and dipped once in the Fire. He will then be asked: 'Have you ever found any good or comfort?' He will reply: 'No.' And a person who had experienced extreme adversity in this world will be brought up and dipped once in the bliss <span class=\"gray\">(of Paradise)</span>. Then he will be asked: 'Did you ever face any hardship or misery?' He will reply: 'No.')</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah said about those who were destroyed:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَصْبَحُوا فِي دِيَارِهِمْ جَاثِمِينَ - كَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْا فِيهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So they lay <span class=\"gray\">(dead)</span>, prostrate in their homes; as if they had never lived there.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[11:67-68]</span> Allah then said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَذَٰلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ الْآيَاتِ</p><p lang=\"su\" class=\"su \"><span class=\"gray\">(Thus do We explain the Ayat...)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">We do explain the proofs, and evidences, in detail</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(for the people who reflect.)</span> so they may take a lesson from this example in the swift vanishing of this world from its people while they are deceived by it. They would trust this world and its promises, and then it unexpectedly turns away from them. This world, in its nature, runs away from those who seek it but seeks those who run away from it. Allah mentioned the parable of this world and the plants of the earth in several Ayat in His Noble Book. He said in Surat Al-Kahf:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاضْرِبْ لَهُم مَّثَلَ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا كَمَاءٍ أَنزَلْنَاهُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَاخْتَلَطَ بِهِ نَبَاتُ الْأَرْضِ فَأَصْبَحَ هَشِيمًا تَذْرُوهُ الرِّيَاحُ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ مُّقْتَدِرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And put forward to them the example of the life of this world: it is like the water <span class=\"gray\">(rain)</span> which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it, and becomes fresh and green. But <span class=\"gray\">(later)</span> it becomes dry and broken pieces, which the winds scatter. And Allah is able to do everything.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(18:45)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He also gave similar examples in both Surat Az-Zumar <span class=\"gray\">[39:21]</span> and Surat Al-Hadid <span class=\"gray\">[57:20]</span>.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Invitation to the Everlasting Gifts that do not vanish</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ يَدْعُو إِلَىٰ دَارِ السَّلَامِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah calls to the Abode of Peace)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When Allah mentioned the swiftness of this world and its termination, He invited people to Paradise and encouraged them to seek it. He called it the Abode of Peace. It is the Abode of Peace because it is free from defects and miseries. So Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ يَدْعُو إِلَىٰ دَارِ السَّلَامِ وَيَهْدِي مَن يَشَاءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah calls to the Home of Peace and guides whom He wills to the straight path.)</span></p><p lang=\"jv\" class=\"jv \">It was narrated that Jabir bin 'Abdullah said: \"Allah's Messenger ﷺ came out one day and said to us:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ فِي الْمَنَامِ كَأَنَّ جِبْرِيلَ عِنْدَ رَأْسِي، وَمِيكَائِيلَ عِنْدَ رِجْلَيَّ، يَقُولُ أَحَدُهُمَا لِصَاحِبِهِ: اضْرِبْ لَهُ مَثَلًا، فَقَالَ: اسْمَعْ، سَمِعَتْ أُذُنُكَ، وَاعْقِلْ، عَقَلَ قَلْبُكَ، إِنَّمَا مَثَلُكَ وَمَثَلُ أُمَّتِكَ كَمَثَلِ مَلِكٍ اتَّخَذَ دَارًا، ثُمَّ بَنَى فِيهَا بَيْتًا، ثُمَّ جَعَلَ فِيهَا مَأْدَبةً، ثُمَّ بَعَثَ رَسُولًا يَدْعُو النَّاسَ إِلَى طَعَامِهِ، فَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ أَجَابَ الرَّسُولَ، وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ تَرَكَهُ، فَاللهُ الْمَلِكُ، وَالدَّارُ الْإِسْلَامُ، وَالْبَيْتُ الْجَنَّةُ، وَأَنْتَ يَا مُحَمَّدُ رَسُولٌ، فَمَنْ أَجَابَكَ دَخَلَ الْإِسْلَامَ، وَمَنْ دَخَلَ الْإِسْلَامَ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ، وَمَنْ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ أَكَلَ مِنْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I have seen in my sleep that it was as if Jibril was at my head and Mika'il at my leg. They were saying to each other: 'Give an example for him.' He said: 'Listen, your ear may listen. And fathom, your heart may fathom. The parable of you and your Ummah is that of a king who has built a house on his land. He arranged a banquet in it. Then he sent a messenger to invite the people to his food. Some accepted the invitation and others did not. Allah is the King and the land is Islam, the house is Paradise and you Muhammad are the Messenger. Whosoever responds to your call enters Islam. And whosoever enters Islam enters Paradise. And whosoever enters Paradise eats from it.)</span> Ibn Jarir recorded this Hadith. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was also reported that Abu Ad-Darda' said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا مِنْ يَوْمٍ طَلَعَتْ فِيهِ الشَّمْسُ إِلَّا وَبِجَنْبَيْهَا مَلَكَانِ يُنَادِيَانِ يَسْمَعُهُ خَلْقُ اللهِ كُلُّهُمْ إِلَّا الثَّقَلَيْنِ: يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ! هَلُمُّوا إِلَى رَبِّكُمْ، إِنَّ مَا قَلَّ وَكَفَى خَيْرٌ مِمَّا كَثُرَ وَأَلْهَى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Two angels descend every day in which the sun rises and say that which all Allah's creatures would hear except Jinn and humans: 'O people! Come to your Lord! Anything little and sufficient is better than a lot but distractive.')</span> And He sent this down in the Qur'an when He said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ يَدْعُو إِلَىٰ دَارِ السَّلَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Allah calls to the Abode of Peace\".)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir recorded this.</p>"

    "text": "<p class=\"en translation\" lang=\"en\">For those who have done good is the best, and even more. Neither darkness nor dust nor any humiliating disgrace shall cover their faces. They are the dwellers of Paradise, they will abide therein forever <span>(26)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Reward of the Good-Doers</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah states that those who do good in this world – by having faith and performing righteous deeds – will be rewarded with a good reward in the Hereafter. Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَلْ جَزَاءُ الْإِحْسَانِ إِلَّا الْإِحْسَانُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Is there any reward for good other than good?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(55:60)</span> Then Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَزِيَادَةٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and even more.)</span> the reward on the good deeds multiplied ten times to seven hundred times and even more on top of that. This reward includes what Allah will give them in Paradise, such as the palaces, Al-Hur <span class=\"gray\">(virgins of Paradise)</span>, and His pleasure upon them. He will give them what He has hidden for them of the delight of the eye. He will grant them on top of all of that and even better, the honor of looking at His Noble Face. This is the increase that is greater than anything that had been given. They will not deserve that because of their deeds, but rather, they will receive it by the grace of Allah and His mercy. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The explanation that this refers to looking at Allah's Noble Face was narrated from Abu Bakr, Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman, 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas, Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib, 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla, 'Abdur-Rahman bin Sabit, Mujahid, 'Ikrimah, 'Amir bin Sa'ad, 'Ata', Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Muhammad bin Ishaq, and others from the earlier and later scholars. There are many Hadiths that contain the same interpretation. Among these Hadiths is what Imam Ahmad recorded from Suhayb that Allah's Messenger ﷺ recited this Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا الْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(For those who have done good is the best and even more.)</span> And then he said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ وَأَهْلُ النَّارِ النَّارَ نَادَى مُنَادٍ: يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ إِنَّ لَكُمْ عِنْدَ اللهِ مَوْعِدًا يُريدُ أَنْ يُنْجِزَكُمُوهُ فَيَقُولُونَ: وَمَا هُوَ؟ أَلَمْ يُثَقِّلْ مَوَازِينَنَا؟ أَلَمْ يُبَيِّضْ وُجُوهَنَا وَيُدْخِلْنَا الْجَنَّــةَ وَيُجِرْنَا مِنَ النَّارِ؟ - قَالَ - فَيَكْشِفُ لَهُمُ الْحِجَابَ، فَيَنْظُرُونَ إِلَيهِ، فَوَاللهِ مَا أَعْطَاهُم اللهُ شَيْئًا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِمْ مِنَ النَّظَرِ إِلَيْهِ، وَلَا أَقَرَّ لِأَعْيُنِهِم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, a caller will say: 'O people of Paradise, Allah has promised you something that He wishes to fulfill.' They will reply: 'What is it Has He not made our Scale heavy? Has He not made our faces white and delivered us from Fire?' Allah will then remove the veil and they will see Him. By Allah, they have not been given anything dearer to them and more delightful than looking at Him.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Muslim and a group of Imams also related this Hadith. </p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah then said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا يَرْهَقُ وُجُوهَهُمْ قَتَرٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Neither darkness nor dust shall cover their faces...)</span> meaning, no blackness or darkness will be on their faces during the different events of the Day of Judgment. But the faces of the rebellious disbelievers will be stained with dust and darkness.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا ذِلَّةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(nor any humiliating disgrace)</span> meaning, they will be covered with degradation and disgrace. The believers, however will not be humiliated internally or externally, on the contrary, they will be protected and honored. For as Allah has said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَوَقَاهُمُ اللَّهُ شَرَّ ذَٰلِكَ الْيَوْمِ وَلَقَّاهُمْ نَضْرَةً وَسُرُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So Allah saved them from the evil of that Day, and gave them Nadrah <span class=\"gray\">(brightness)</span> and joy.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[76:11]</span> meaning, light in their faces and delight in their hearts. May Allah make us among those by His grace and mercy.</p>"
