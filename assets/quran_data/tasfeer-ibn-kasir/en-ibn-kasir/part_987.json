Musa did that.\" As-Suddi commented,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِذَا هِيَ ثُعْبَانٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and behold!

When Fir'awn saw the snake, he was frightened, so he jumped and wet himself and he never wet himself before this incident. He cried, 'O Musa! Take it away and I will believe in you and release the Children of Israel to you.'
