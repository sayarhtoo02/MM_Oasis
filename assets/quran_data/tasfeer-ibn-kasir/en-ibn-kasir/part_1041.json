    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Virtues of Surat Al-A'la</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Surah was revealed in Makkah before the migration to Al-Madinah. The proof of this is what Al-Bukhari recorded from Al-Bara' bin 'Azib, that he said, \"The first people to come to us <span class=\"gray\">(in Al-Madinah)</span> from the Companions of the Prophet were ﷺ Mus'ab bin 'Umayr and Ibn Umm Maktum, who taught us the Qur'an; then 'Ammar, Bilal and Sa'd came. Then 'Umar bin Al-Khattab came with a group of twenty people, after which the Prophet ﷺ came. I have not seen the people of Al-Madinah happier with anything more than their happiness with his coming <span class=\"gray\">(to Al-Madinah)</span>. This was reached to such an extent that I saw the children and little ones saying, 'This is the Messenger of Allah who has come.' Thus, he came, but he did not come until after I had already recited <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., learned how to recite)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الْأَعْلَى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(87:1)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">as well as other Surahs similar to it.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Mu'adh,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">هَلَّا صَلَّيْتَ بِــ</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الْأَعْلَى</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَالشَّمْسِ وَضُحَاهَا</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Why didn't you recite \"Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High,\"; \"By the sun and its brightness,\" and \"By the night when it envelopes.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded from An-Nu'man bin Bashir that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الْأَعْلَى</p><p class=\"qpc-hafs\">وَ</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ الْغَاشِيَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Surat Al-A'la <span class=\"gray\">(chapter 87)</span> and Surat Al-Ghashiyh <span class=\"gray\">(chapter 88)</span> in the two 'Id prayers. If the 'Id prayer fell on Friday, he would recite them in both prayers <span class=\"gray\">('Id and Salat Al-Jumu'ah)</span>. Muslim also recorded this in his Sahih, as well as Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. The wording of Muslim and the Sunan compilers says, \"He used to recite</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الْأَعْلَى</p><p class=\"qpc-hafs\">وَ</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ الْغَاشِيَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Surat Al-A'la <span class=\"gray\">(chapter 87)</span> and Surat Al-Ghashiyh <span class=\"gray\">(chapter 88)</span> for the two 'Ids and Jumu'ah.

Meaning, 'do not forget what We teach you to recite, except what Allah wills, which He removes and there is no sin on your leaving it off <span class=\"gray\">(not retaining it)</span>.' Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّهُ يَعْلَمُ الْجَهْرَ وَمَا يَخْفَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He knows what is apparent and what is hidden.)</span> meaning, He knows what the creatures do openly and what they hide, whether it be statements or deeds. None of that is hidden from Him.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَنُيَسِّرُكَ لِلْيُسْرَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We shall make easy for you the easy.)</span> meaning, 'We will make good deeds and statements easy for you, and We will legislate such Law for you that is easy, tolerant, straight and just, with no crookedness, difficulty or hardship in it.'</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Command to Remind</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَذَكِّرْ إِن نَّفَعَتِ الذِّكْرَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Therefore remind in case the reminder profits.)</span> meaning, remind where reminding is beneficial.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">From here we get the etiquette of spreading knowledge, that it should not be wasted upon those who are not suitable or worthy of it. The Commander of the believers, 'Ali said, \"You do not tell people any statement that their intellects do not grasp except that it will be a Fitnah <span class=\"gray\">(trial)</span> for some of them.\" He also said, \"Tell people that which they know. Would you like for Allah and His Messenger to be rejected?\"</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَيَذَّكَّرُ مَن يَخْشَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The reminder will be received by him who fears,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, 'he whose heart fears Allah and who knows that he is going to meet Him, will receive admonition from what you convey to him, O Muhammad.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الْأَشْقَى - الَّذِي يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَىٰ - ثُمَّ لَا يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلَا يَحْيَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But it will be avoided by the wretched, who will enter the great Fire. There he will neither die nor live.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, he will not die and thus be allowed to rest, nor will he live a life that is beneficial to him. Instead, his life will be harmful to him, because it will be the cause of his feeling of the pain of torment and various types of punishments what he is being punished with.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Sa'id that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمَّا أَهْلُ النَّارِ الَّذِينَ هُمْ أَهْلُهَا لَا يَمُوتُونَ وَلَا يَحْيَوْنَ، وَأَمَّا أُنَاسٌ يُرِيدُ اللهُ بِهِمُ الرَّحْمَةَ فَيُمِيتُهُمْ فِي النَّارِ فَيَدْخُلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الشُّفَعَاءُ فَيَأْخُذُ الرَّجُلُ الضِّبَارَةَ فَيُنْبِتُهُمْ - أو قال: يَنْبُتُونَ فِي نَهْرِ الْحَيَا، أو قال: الْحَيَاةِ، أو قال: الْحَيَوَانِ أو قال: نَهْرِ الْجَنَّةِ - فَيَنْبُتُونَ نَبَاتَ الْحِبَّةِ فِي حَمِيلِ السَّيْلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Concerning the people of the Fire who are deserving of it, they will not die nor will they live.

Then they will sprout up like the sprouting of the seed on the moist bank of a flowing stream.)</span></span></span></p><p lang=\"nl\" class=\"nl \">Then the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمَا تَرَوْنَ الشَّجَرَةَ تَكُونُ خَضْرَاءَ، ثُمَّ تَكُونُ صَفْرَاءَ، ثُمَّ تَكُونُ خَضْرَاءَ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Haven't you all seen the tree that is green, then it turns yellow, then it turns green <span class=\"gray\">(again)</span>?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abu Sa'id then said that some of those present said, \"It is as if the Prophet ﷺ used to live in the desert wilderness <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., due to his parables of nature)</span>.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ahmad also recorded from Abu Sa'id that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمَّا أَهْلُ النَّارِ الَّذِينَ هُمْ أَهْلُهَا فَإِنَّهُمْ لَا يَمُوتُونَ فِيهَا وَلَا يَحْيَوْنَ، وَلَٰــكِنْ أُنَاسٌ - أو كما قال - تُصِيبُهُمُ النَّارُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ - أو قال: بِخَطَايَاهُمْ - فَيُمِيتُهُمْ إِمَاتَةً حَتّٰى إِذَا صَارُوا فَحْمًا أُذِنَ فِي الشَّفَاعَةِ، فَجِيءَ بِهِمْ ضَبَائِرَ ضَبَائِرَ فَبُثُّوا عَلى أَنْهَارِ الْجَنَّةِ فَيُقَالُ: يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ أَفِيضُوا عَلَيْهِمْ، فَيَنْبُتُونَ نَبَاتَ الْحِبَّةِ تَكُونُ فِي حَمِيلِ السَّيْلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Concerning the people of the Fire who will be dwellers of it, they will not die in it nor will they live. However, there will be a group of people - or as he said - whom the Fire will burn due to their sins - or he said - their wrongdoings. So, He will cause them to die until they become burnt coal. Then the intercession will be allowed and they will be brought group after group, and they will be scattered over the rivers of Paradise. Then it will be said: \"O people of Paradise! Pour down upon them.\" Then they will sprout like the growing of the seed that is upon the moist bank of the flowing stream.\"</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then, a man from among the people present said, \"It is as if the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to live in the desert wilderness.\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith.</p>"
