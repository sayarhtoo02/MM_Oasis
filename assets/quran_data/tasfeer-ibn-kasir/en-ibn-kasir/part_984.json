    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Has there come to you the story of Musa <span>(15)</span>When his Lord called him in the holy valley of Tuwa <span>(16)</span>Go to Fir'awn; verily, he has transgressed all bounds <span>(17)</span>And say to him: \"Would you purify yourself? <span>(18)</span>\"And that I guide you to your Lord, so you should fear Him? <span>(19)</span>Then he showed him the great sign <span>(20)</span>But he denied and disobeyed <span>(21)</span>Then he turned back, striving <span>(22)</span>So he gathered and called out <span>(23)</span>Saying: \"I am your lord, most high. <span>(24)</span>So Allah seized him with punishing example for the Hereafter and the first <span class=\"gray\">(life)</span><span>(25)</span>In this is a lesson for whoever fears <span>(26)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Mentioning the Story of Musa and that it is a Lesson for Those Who fear Allah</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah informs His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ about His Messenger Musa. He mentions that he sent Musa to Fir'awn and He aided him with miracles. Yet, even after this, Fir'awn continued in his disbelief and transgression until Allah seized him with a mighty and powerful punishment. Thus is the punishment of whoever opposes you <span class=\"gray\">(Muhammad ﷺ)</span> and rejects that which you have been sent with. This is why Allah says at the end of the story,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In this is a Lesson for whoever fears.)</span></p><p lang=\"jv\" class=\"jv \">Allah begins by saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ مُوسَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Has there come to you the story of Musa?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, have you heard of his story?</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">إِذْ نَادَاهُ رَبُّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When his Lord called him)</span> meaning, He called out speaking to him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِالْوَادِ الْمُقَدَّسِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(in the holy valley)</span> meaning purified</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">طُوًى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Tuwa)</span> According to what is correct, it is the name of a valley, as preceded in Surah Ta Ha. So, He said to him:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اذْهَبْ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ طَغَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Go to Fir'awn; verily, he has transgressed all bounds.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, he has become haughty, rebellious and arrogant.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَقُلْ هَل لَّكَ إِلَىٰ أَن تَزَكَّىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And say to him: \"Would you purify yourself'?')</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, say to him, \"Will you respond to the path and way that will purify you?\" This means, 'will you submit <span class=\"gray\">(accept Islam)</span> and be obedient?'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَهْدِيَكَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And that I guide to your Lord,)</span> meaning, 'I will guide you to the worship of your Lord.'</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">فَتَخْشَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so that you fear)</span> meaning, 'so that your heart will become humble, obedient, and submissive to Him after it was hard, evil, and far away from goodness.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَرَاهُ الْآيَةَ الْكُبْرَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then he showed him the great sign.)</span> This means that Musa showed him – along with this truthful call – a strong evidence and a clear proof of the truthfulness of what he had come up with from Allah.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَكَذَّبَ وَعَصَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But he denied and disobeyed.)</span> meaning, he <span class=\"gray\">(Fir'awn)</span> rejected the truth and opposed what Musa commanded him with of obedience. So what happened with him was that his heart disbelieved, and Musa <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., his call)</span> could not internally or externally affect it. Along with this, his knowledge that what Musa had come to him with was the truth, did not necessitate his being a believer in it. This is because recognition is the knowledge of the heart, and faith is its action. And it <span class=\"gray\">(faith)</span> is to comply with the truth and submit to it.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ يَسْعَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then he turned back, striving.)</span> meaning, in responding to the truth with falsehood. This was by his gathering the group of magicians in order to confront that which Musa had come up with of spectacular miracles.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So he gathered <span class=\"gray\">(his people)</span> and called out)</span> meaning, among his people.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَقَالَ أَنَا رَبُّكُمُ الْأَعْلَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Saying; I am your lord, most high.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas and Mujahid both said, \"This is the word which Fir'awn said after he said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا عَلِمْتُ لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرِي </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">('I have not known of any other god for you all other than me)</span><span class=\"gray\">(28:38)</span> for the past forty years.'\" Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الْآخِرَةِ وَالْأُولَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So Allah seized him with a punishing example for the Hereafter and the first <span class=\"gray\">(life)</span>.</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, Allah avenged Himself against him with a severe vengeance, and He made an example and admonition of him for those rebellious people in the world who are like him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۚ بِئْسَ الرِّفْدُ الْمَرْفُودُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And on the Day of Resurrection, evil indeed is the gift gifted <span class=\"gray\">[i.e., the curse <span class=\"gray\">(in this world)</span> pursued by another curse <span class=\"gray\">(in this world)</span> pursued by another curse <span class=\"gray\">(in the Hereafter)</span>]</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11:99)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ أَئِمَّةً يَدْعُونَ إِلَى النَّارِ ۖ وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ لَا يُنصَرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We made them leaders inviting to the Fire: and on the Day of Resurrection, they will not be helped.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(28:41)</span></p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In this is a lesson for whoever fears.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَأَنتُمْ أَشَدُّ خَلْقًا أَمِ السَّمَاءُ ۚ بَنَاهَا - رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا - وَأَغْطَشَ لَيْلَهَا وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَاهَا - وَالْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ دَحَاهَا - أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَاءَهَا وَمَرْعَاهَا - وَالْجِبَالَ أَرْسَاهَا - مَتَاعًا لَّكُمْ وَلِأَنْعَامِكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(27. Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(28. He raised its height, and has perfected it.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(29. Its night He covers and He brings out its forenoon.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(30. And after that He spread the earth,)</span><span class=\"gray\">(31. And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(32. And the mountains He has fixed firmly,)</span><span class=\"gray\">(33. As provision and benefit for you and your cattle.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Creating the Heavens and the Earth is more difficult than repeating Creation</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In refutation of the claim rejecting resurrection due to the renewal of creation after its original state, Allah says;</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">أَأَنتُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Are you)</span> 'O people'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَشَدُّ خَلْقًا أَمِ السَّمَاءُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(more difficult to create or is the heaven…?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, 'rather the heaven is more difficult to create than you.' As Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَخَلْقُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of mankind;)</span><span class=\"gray\">(40:57)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And His saying;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوَلَيْسَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَىٰ أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُم ۚ بَلَىٰ وَهُوَ الْخَلَّاقُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Is not the One Who created the heavens and the earth, capable of creating the similar to them. Yes, indeed! He is the Supreme Creator, the All-Knowing.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(36:81)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\"> بَنَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He constructed)</span> He explains this by His statement,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He raised its height, and has perfected it.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, He made it a lofty structure, vast in its space, with equal sides, and adorned with stars at night and in the darkness. Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَأَغْطَشَ لَيْلَهَا وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Its night He covers and He brings out its forenoon.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, He made its night dark and extremely black, and its day bright, luminous, shining and clear. Ibn 'Abbas said, \"He did Aghtasha of its night means that He made it dark.\" Mujahid, 'Ikrimah, Sa'id bin Jubayr and a large group have said this as well. In reference to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He brings out its forenoon.)</span> meaning, He illuminated its day. Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ دَحَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And after that He spread the earth,)</span> He explains this statement by the statement that follows it,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَاءَهَا وَمَرْعَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It already has been mentioned previously in Surat Ha Mim As-Sajdah that the earth was created before the heaven was created, but it was only spread out after the creation of the heaven. This means that He brought out what was in it with a forceful action. This is the meaning of what was said by Ibn 'Abbas and others, and it was the explanation preferred by Ibn Jarir.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In reference to the statement of Allah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْجِبَالَ أَرْسَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the mountains He has fixed firmly,)</span> meaning, He settled them, made them firm, and established them in their places. And He is the Most Wise, the All-Knowing. He is Most Kind to His creation, Most Merciful.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">مَتَاعًا لَّكُمْ وَلِأَنْعَامِكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(As provision and benefit for you and your cattle.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, He spread out the earth, caused its springs to gush forth, brought forth its hidden benefits, caused its rivers to flow, and caused its vegetation, trees, and fruits to grow. He also made its mountains firm so that it <span class=\"gray\">(the earth)</span> would be calmly settled with its dwellers, and He stabilized its dwelling places. All of this is a means of beneficial enjoyment for His creatures <span class=\"gray\">(mankind)</span> providing them of what cattle they need, which they eat and ride upon. He has granted them these beneficial things for the period that they need them, in this worldly abode, until the end of time and the expiration of this life.</p>"
