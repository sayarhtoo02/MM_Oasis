    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And strain not your eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to various groups of them, the splendor of the life of this world, that We may test them thereby. But the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting <span>(131)</span>And enjoin Salah on your family, and be patient in offering them. We ask not of you a provision: We provide for you. And the good end is for those who have Taqwa <span>(132)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Do not look at the Enjoyment of the Wealthy, be patient in the worship of Allah</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah, the Exalted, says to His Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, \"Do not look at what these people of luxury and their likes and peers have of nice comforts. For verily, it is only short-lived splendor and a feeble bounty, which We are using to test them with. And very few of My servants are truly thankful.\" Mujahid said,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">أَزْوَاجًا مِّنْهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(various groups of them,)</span> \"This means the wealthy people.\" This means, \"Verily, We have given you <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad)</span> better than that which We have given them.\" This is just as Allah says in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَاكَ سَبْعًا مِّنَ الْمَثَانِي وَالْقُرْآنَ الْعَظِيمَ - لَا تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And indeed, We have bestowed upon you seven repeatedly recited verses, and the Grand Qur'an. Look not with your eyes ambitiously.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[15:87-88]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Likewise, that which Allah has stored for His Messenger ﷺ in the Hereafter is something extremely great. It is an unlimited reward that cannot be described. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, your Lord will give you so that you shall be well-pleased.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[93:5]</span> For this reason, Allah says,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَرِزْقُ رَبِّكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting.)</span> In the Sahih it is recorded that 'Umar bin Al-Khattab entered upon the Messenger of Allah ﷺ while he was in the small room in which he had separated himself from his wives after he had vowed to stay away from them. When he came in, he saw him <span class=\"gray\">(the Prophet ﷺ)</span> lying down upon a sandy straw mat. There was nothing in the house except a pile of sant tree pods and some hanging equipment. 'Umar's eyes filled with tears <span class=\"gray\">(upon seeing this)</span>, so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَايُبْكِيكَ يَا عُمَرُ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(What makes you cry, O Umar?)</span> He replied, \"O Messenger of Allah, verily Kisra and Caesar are living in their luxurious conditions, yet you are the chosen Friend of Allah amongst His creation?\" The Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوَ فِي شَكٍّ أَنْتَ يَا ابْنَ الْخَطَّابِ؟ أُولَئِكَ قَوْمٌ عُجِّلَتْ لَهُمْ طَيِّبَاتُهُمْ فِي حَيَاتِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do you have doubt, O son of Al-Khattab? Those people have had their good hastened for them in the life of this world.)</span> Thus, the Prophet ﷺ was the most abstinent of people concerning worldly luxuries, even though he had the ability to attain them. If he acquired anything of worldly treasures he would spend it on this and that for the servants of Allah. He would never save anything for himself for the next day.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim reported from Abu Sa'id that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ مَا يَفْتَحُ اللهُ لَكُمْ مِنْ زَهْرَةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the thing I fear most for you all is what Allah will allow you to acquire of the splendor of this world.)</span> They <span class=\"gray\">(the Companions)</span> said, \"What is the splendor of this world, O Messenger of Allah?\" He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَرَكَاتُ الْأَرْضِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The blessings of the earth.)</span> Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"The splendor of this worldly life means the beautiful adornments of the life of this world.\" Qatadah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that We may test them thereby.)</span> \"So that We may put them to trial.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِالصَّلَاةِ وَاصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And enjoin the Salah on your family, and be patient in offering them.)</span> This means to save them from the punishment of Allah by the establishment of the prayer, and you also be patient in performing it. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قُوا أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَارًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire <span class=\"gray\">(Hell)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[66:6]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Zayd bin Aslam reported from his father that he and Yarfa' would sometimes spend the night at 'Umar bin Al-Khattab's. 'Umar had a certain time of night that he would get up and pray. However, sometimes he would not get up for it. Then, we would say, \"He is not going to get up like he usually does.\" When he would awaken, he would make his family get up as well. He would say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأْمُرْ أَهْلَكَ بِالصَّلَاةِ وَاصْطَبِرْ عَلَيْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And enjoin the Salah on your family, and be patient in offering them.)</span>\" Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا نَسْأَلُكَ رِزْقًا ۖ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We ask not of you a provision: We provide for you.)</span> This means that if you establish the prayer, your sustenance will come to you from where you did not expect. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجًا - وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَحْتَسِبُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out <span class=\"gray\">(from every difficulty)</span>. And He will provide him from <span class=\"gray\">(sources)</span> he never could imagine.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[65:2-3]</span> Allah also says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And I <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span> created not the Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me <span class=\"gray\">(Alone)</span>.)</span> until,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, the Most Strong.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(51:56-58)</span> Thus, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا نَسْأَلُكَ رِزْقًا ۖ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We ask not of you a provision: We provide for you.)</span></p><p lang=\"fil\" class=\"fil \">Verily, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى: يَا ابْنَ آدَمَ تَفَرَّغْ لِعِبَادَتِي أَمْلَأْ صَدْرَكَ غِنىً وَأَسُدَّ فَقْرَكَ، وَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْعَلْ، مَلَأْتُ صَدْرَكَ شُغْلًا وَلَمْ أَسُدَّ فَقْرَكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah, the Exalted, says, \"O son of Adam, perform My worship and I will fill your chest with wealth and fulfill your needs. If you do not do so, then I will fill your chest with toil and I will not fulfill your needs.\")</span> It is also reported from Zayd bin Thabit that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا هَمَّهُ فَرَّقَ اللهُ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرَهُ، وَجَعَلَ فَقْرَهُ بَيْنَ عَيْنَيْهِ، وَلَمْ يَأْتِهِ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا مَا كُتِبَ لَهُ، وَمَنْ كَانَتِ الْآخِرَةُ نِيَّتَهُ، جَمَعَ لَهُ أَمْرَهُ وَجَعَلَ غِنَاهُ فِي قَلْبِهِ، وَأَتَتْهُ الدُّنْيَا وَهِيَ رَاغِمَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever makes the worldly life his major concern, then Allah will scatter his situation for him <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. make it difficult)</span> and his poverty will be placed between his eyes. He will not get from this world anything except that which has already been written for him. Whoever makes the Hereafter his intention, then his situation will be gathered for him <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. made easy)</span> and his wealth will be placed in his heart. The worldly life will come to him anyway <span class=\"gray\">(in spite of his not seeking it)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْعَاقِبَةُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the good end is for those who have Taqwa.)</span> This means the good end in this life and in the Hereafter. In the Hereafter the good end will be Paradise for whoever feared Allah. In the Sahih it is reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"I saw in my dream tonight a vision as if we were in the home of 'Uqbah bin Raafi' and we were given fresh Ibn Taab dates. Therefore, I interpreted this dream to mean that the good final outcome <span class=\"gray\">('Aaqibah)</span> is for us in this world along with lofty <span class=\"gray\">(Rifa'ah)</span> positions, and that our religion is good <span class=\"gray\">(Taab)</span>.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالُوا لَوْلَا يَأْتِينَا بِآيَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِ ۚ أَوَلَمْ تَأْتِهِم بَيِّنَةُ مَا فِي الصُّحُفِ الْأُولَىٰ - وَلَوْ أَنَّا أَهْلَكْنَاهُم بِعَذَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِهِ لَقَالُوا رَبَّنَا لَوْلَا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولًا فَنَتَّبِعَ آيَاتِكَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن نَّذِلَّ وَنَخْزَىٰ - قُلْ كُلٌّ مُّتَرَبِّصٌ فَتَرَبَّصُوا ۖ فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ مَنْ أَصْحَابُ الصِّرَاطِ السَّوِيِّ وَمَنِ اهْتَدَىٰ</p>"
