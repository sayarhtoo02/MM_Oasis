Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا لَمْ تَأْتِهِم بِآيَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if you do not bring them an Ayah)</span> a miracle or a sign. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِن نَّشَأْ نُنَزِّلْ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ آيَةً فَظَلَّتْ أَعْنَاقُهُمْ لَهَا خَاضِعِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[26:4]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The pagans asked the Prophet, why did you not strive hard to bring us an Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(miracle)</span> from Allah so that we witness it and believe in it. Allah said to him,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ إِنَّمَا أَتَّبِعُ مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ مِن رَّبِّي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"I but follow what is revealed to me from my Lord.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">I do not ask such things of my Lord. I only follow what He reveals and commands me. Therefore, if Allah sends a miracle, I will accept it. Otherwise, I will not ask for it unless He allows me. Certainly, Allah is Most Wise, the All-Knower. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah next directs the servants to the fact that this Qur'an is the most powerful miracle, clearest evidence and most true proof and explanation, saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَٰذَا بَصَائِرُ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(This <span class=\"gray\">(the Qur'an)</span> is nothing but evidences from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe.)</span></p>"

    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And remember your Lord within yourself, humbly and with fear and without loudness in words in the mornings and in the afternoons, and be not of those who are neglectful <span>(205)</span>Surely, those who are with your Lord <span class=\"gray\">(angels)</span> are never too proud to perform acts of worship to Him, but they glorify His praise and prostrate themselves before Him <span>(206)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Remembering Allah in the Mornings and Afternoons</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah ordains that He be remembered more often in the mornings and the afternoons. Just as He ordered that He be worshipped during these two times when He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَقَبْلَ الْغُرُوبِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And glorify the praises of your Lord, before the rising of the sun and before <span class=\"gray\">(its)</span> setting.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[50:39]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Before the night of Isra', when the five daily prayers were ordained, this Ayah was revealed in Makkah ordering that Allah be worshipped at these times, Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">تَضَرُّعًا وَخِيفَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(humbly and with fear)</span> meaning, remember your Lord in secret, not loudly, with eagerness and fear. This is why Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَدُونَ الْجَهْرِ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and without loudness in words)</span>. Therefore, it is recommended that remembering Allah in Dhikr is not performed in a loud voice. When the Companions asked the Messenger of Allah, \"Is our Lord close, so that we call Him in secret, or far, so that we raise our voices?\" Allah sent down the verse,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِي عَنِّي فَإِنِّي قَرِيبٌ أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ الدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then <span class=\"gray\">(answer them)</span>, I am indeed near <span class=\"gray\">(to them by My knowledge)</span>. I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me <span class=\"gray\">(without any mediator or intercessor)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:186]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari said, \"The people raised their voices with Du'a' <span class=\"gray\">(invoking Allah)</span> while travelling. The Prophet ﷺ said to them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ ارْبَعُوا عَلَى أَنْفُسِكُمْ، فَإِنَّكُمْ لَا تَدْعُونَ أَصَمَّ وَلَا غَائِبًا إِنَّ الَّذِي تَدْعُونَهُ سَمِيعٌ قَرِيبٌ أَقْرَبُ إِلَى أَحَدِكُمْ مِنْ عُنُقِ رَاحِلِتهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O people! Take it easy on yourselves, for He Whom you are calling is not deaf or absent. Verily, He Whom you are calling is the All-Hearer, close <span class=\"gray\">(by His knowledge)</span>, closer to one of you than the neck of his animal.)</span>\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">These texts encourage the servants to invoke Allah in Dhikr often, especially in the mornings and afternoons, so that they are not among those who neglect remembering Him. This is why Allah praised the angels who praise Him night and day without tiring,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ عِندَ رَبِّكَ لَا يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely, those who are with your Lord <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., angels)</span> are never too proud to perform acts of worship to Him)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah reminded the servants of this fact so that they imitate the angels in their tireless worship and obedience of Allah. Prostration, here, upon the mention that the angels prostrate to Allah is legitimate. A Hadith reads;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَا تَصُفُّونَ كَمَا تَصُفُّ الْمَلَائِكَةُ عِنْدَ رَبِّهَا يُتِمُّونَ الصُّفُوفَ الْأُوَلَ وَيَتَرَاصُّونَ فِي الصَّفِّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Why not you stand in line <span class=\"gray\">(for the prayer)</span> like the angels stand in line before their Lord? They continue the first then the next lines and they stand close to each other in line.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the first place in the Qur'an where it has been legitimized – according to the agreement of the scholars – for the readers of the Qur'an, and those listening to its recitation, to perform prostration.</p>"

So he started running in fright through Paradise, but a tree in Paradise took him by the head. He said to it, 'Release me,' but it said, 'No, I will not release you.' So his Lord called him, 'O Adam! Do you run away from Me?' He said, 'O Lord! I felt ashamed before You.'\" Ibn Jarir and Ibn Marduwyah collected this statement using several chains of narration from Al-Hasan from Ubayy bin Ka'b who narrated it from the Prophet ﷺ. However, relating the Hadith to Ubayy is more correct.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas commented on the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise.)</span> \"Using fig leaves.\" This statement has an authentic chain of narration leading to Ibn 'Abbas.

When they ate from the tree, their private parts appeared to them.\" Ibn Jarir reported this statement with an authentic chain of narration. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abdur-Razzaq reported from Qatadah, \"Adam said, 'O Lord! What if I repented and sought forgiveness?' Allah said, 'Then, I will admit you into Paradise.' As for Shaytan, he did not ask for forgiveness, but for respite. Each one of them was given what he asked for.\" Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim commented,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبَّنَا ظَلَمْنَا أَنفُسَنَا وَإِن لَّمْ تَغْفِرْ لَنَا وَتَرْحَمْنَا لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Our Lord!
