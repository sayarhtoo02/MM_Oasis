What are they asking about?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2. About the great news,)</span><span class=\"gray\">(3. About which they are in disagreement.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4. Nay, they will come to know!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(5. Nay, again, they will come to know!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6. Have We not made the earth as a bed,)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7. And the mountains as pegs?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(8. And We have created you in pairs.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(9. And We have made your sleep as a thing for rest.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(10. And We have made the night as a covering,)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11. And We have made the day for livelihood.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(12. And We have built above you seven strong,)</span><span class=\"gray\">(13. And We have made <span class=\"gray\">(therein)</span> a shining lamp.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(14. And We have sent down from the Mu'sirat water Thajjaj.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(15. That We may produce therewith grains and vegetations,)</span><span class=\"gray\">(16. And gardens that are Alfaf.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Refutation against the Idolators' Denial of the Occurrence of the Day of Judgement</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In rejection of the idolators' questioning about the Day of Judgement, due to their denial of its occurrence, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَمَّ يَتَسَاءَلُونَ - عَنِ النَّبَإِ الْعَظِيمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(What are they asking about? About the great news,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, what are they asking about? They are asking about the matter of the Day of Judgement, and it is the great news. Meaning the dreadful, horrifying, overwhelming information.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِي هُمْ فِيهِ مُخْتَلِفُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(About which they are in disagreement.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, the people are divided into two ideas about it. There are those who believe in it and those who disbelieve in it. Then Allah threatens those who deny the Day of Judgement by saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَلَّا سَيَعْلَمُونَ - ثُمَّ كَلَّا سَيَعْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Nay, they will come to know! Nay, again, they will come to know!)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is a severe threat and a direct warning.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Mentioning Allah's Power, and the Proof of His Ability to resurrect the Dead</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then, Allah begins to explain His great ability to create strange things and amazing matters. He brings this as a proof of His ability to do whatever He wishes concerning the matter of the Hereafter and other matters as well. He says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَمْ نَجْعَلِ الْأَرْضَ مِهَادًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Have We not made the earth as a bed,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, an established, firm and peaceful resting place that is subservient to them.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْجِبَالَ أَوْتَادًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the mountains as pegs?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, He made them as pegs for the earth to hold it in place, make it stable and firm. This is so that it may be suitable for dwelling and not quake with those who are in it. Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَخَلَقْنَاكُمْ أَزْوَاجًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We have created you in pairs.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"> meaning, male and female, both of them enjoying each other, and by this means procreation is achieved. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَنْ خَلَقَ لَكُم مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَزْوَاجًا لِّتَسْكُنُوا إِلَيْهَا وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَكُم مَّوَدَّةً وَرَحْمَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And among His signs is this that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(30:21)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَعَلْنَا نَوْمَكُمْ سُبَاتًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We have made your sleep as a thing for rest.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, a cessation of movement in order to attain rest from the frequent repetition and going about in search of livelihood during the day. A similar Ayah has been mentioned previously in Surat Al-Furqan.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَعَلْنَا اللَّيْلَ لِبَاسًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We have made the night as a covering,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, its shade and darkness covers the people. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By the night as it conceals it.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(91:4)</span></p><p lang=\"la\" class=\"la \">Qatadah commented;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَعَلْنَا اللَّيْلَ لِبَاسًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We have made the night as a covering,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, a tranquil residence. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَعَلْنَا النَّهَارَ مَعَاشًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We have made the day for livelihood.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, 'We made it radiant, luminous, and shining so that the people would be able to move about in it.' By it they are able to come and go for their livelihood, earning, business dealings and other than that as well. In reference to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَبَنَيْنَا فَوْقَكُمْ سَبْعًا شِدَادًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We have built above you seven strong,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, the seven heavens in their vastness, loftiness, perfection, precision, and adornment with both stable and moving stars. Thus, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَعَلْنَا سِرَاجًا وَهَّاجًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We have made <span class=\"gray\">(therein)</span> a shining lamp.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, the radiant sun that gives light to all of the world. Its light glows for all of the people of the earth. Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ الْمُعْصِرَاتِ مَاءً ثَجَّاجًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We have sent down from the Mu'sirat water Thajjaj.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn 'Abbas that he said, \"From the Mu'sirat means from the clouds.\" This was also stated by 'Ikrimah, Abu Al-'Aliyah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Ar-Rabi' bin Anas, Ath-Thawri, and it is preferred by Ibn Jarir. Al-Farra' said, \"They are the clouds that are filled with rain, but they do not bring rain. This is like the woman being called Mu'sir when <span class=\"gray\">(the time of)</span> her menstrual cycle approaches, yet she does not menstruate.\" This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللَّهُ الَّذِي يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ فَتُثِيرُ سَحَابًا فَيَبْسُطُهُ فِي السَّمَاءِ كَيْفَ يَشَاءُ وَيَجْعَلُهُ كِسَفًا فَتَرَى الْوَدْقَ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ خِلَالِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah is He Who sends the winds, so that they raise clouds, and spread them along the sky as He wills, and then break them into fragments, until you see rain drops come forth from their midst!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(30:48)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, from its midst. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">مَاءً ثَجَّاجًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(water Thajjaj)</span> Mujahid, Qatadah, and Ar-Rabi' bin Anas all said, \"Thajjaj means poured out.\" At-Thawri said, \"Continuous.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"Abundant.\" In the Hadith of the woman with prolonged menstrual bleeding, when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to her,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنْعَتُ لَكِ الْكُرْسُفَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I suggest you to make an absorbent cloth for yourself.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Meaning, 'dress the area with cotton.' The woman replied, \"O Messenger of Allah! It <span class=\"gray\">(the bleeding)</span> is too much for that. Verily, it flows in profusely <span class=\"gray\">(Thajja)</span>.\" This contains an evidence for using the word Thajj to mean abundant, continuous and flowing. And Allah knows best. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِّنُخْرِجَ بِهِ حَبًّا وَنَبَاتًا - وَجَنَّاتٍ أَلْفَافًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That We may produce therewith corn and vegetation, and gardens that are Alfaf.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, 'so that We may bring out great abundance, goodness, benefit, and blessing through this water.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَبًّا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(grains)</span> This refers to that which is preserved for <span class=\"gray\">(the usage)</span> of humans and cattle.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَنَبَاتًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and vegetations)</span> meaning, vegetables that are eaten fresh.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَنَّاتٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And gardens)</span> meaning, gardens of various fruits, differing colors, and a wide variety of tastes and fragrances, even if it is ingathered at one location of the earth. This is why Allah says</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَنَّاتٍ أَلْفَافًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And gardens that are Alfaf.)</span> Ibn 'Abbas and other said, \"Alfaf means gathered.\" This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَفِي الْأَرْضِ قِطَعٌ مُّتَجَاوِرَاتٌ وَجَنَّاتٌ مِّنْ أَعْنَابٍ وَزَرْعٌ وَنَخِيلٌ صِنْوَانٌ وَغَيْرُ صِنْوَانٍ يُسْقَىٰ بِمَاءٍ وَاحِدٍ وَنُفَضِّلُ بَعْضَهَا عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ فِي الْأُكُلِ ۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And in the earth are neighboring tracts, and gardens of vines, and green crops, and date palms, growing into two or three from a single stem root, or otherwise, watered with the same water; yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat. Verily, in these things there are Ayat for the people who understand.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(13:4)</span></p>"
