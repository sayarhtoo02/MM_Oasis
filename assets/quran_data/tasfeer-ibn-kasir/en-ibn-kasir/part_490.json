His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years – give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination <span>(14)</span>But if they strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do <span>(15)</span></p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">Luqman's Advice to His Son</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah tells us how Luqman advised his son. His full name was Luqman bin 'Anqa' bin Sadun, and his son's name was Tharan, according to a saying quoted by As-Suhayli. Allah describes him in the best terms, and states that he granted him wisdom. Luqman advised his son, the closest and most beloved of all people to him, who deserved to be given the best of his knowledge. So, Luqman started by advising him to worship Allah Alone, and not to associate anything with Him. Then he warned him:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, joining others in worship with Allah is a great Zulm <span class=\"gray\">(wrong)</span> indeed.)</span> meaning, it is the greatest wrong. Al-Bukhari recorded that 'Abdullah said: \"When the Ayah</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَلَمْ يَلْبِسُوا إِيمَانَهُمْ بِظُلْمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is those who believe and confuse not their belief with Zulm)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:82)</span> was revealed, the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ were distressed by this, and said, 'Who among us does not confuse his belief with Zulm?' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ بِذَاكَ، أَلَا تَسْمَعُ إِلَى قَوْلِ لُقْمَانَ: يَا بُنَيَّ لَا تُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ ۖ إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That is not what it means. Have you not heard what Luqman said: <span class=\"gray\">(O my son! Join not in worship others with Allah. Verily, joining others in worship with Allah is a great Zulm <span class=\"gray\">(wrong)</span> indeed)</span>?)</span>\" It was recorded by Muslim.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When Luqman advised his son to worship Allah Alone, he also told him to honor his parents. This is like the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَضَىٰ رَبُّكَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا ۚ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents)</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:23)</span>. These two things are often mentioned together in the Qur'an. Allah says here:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَوَصَّيْنَا الْإِنْسَانَ بِوَالِدَيْهِ حَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُ وَهْنًا عَلَىٰ وَهْنٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We have enjoined on man <span class=\"gray\">(to be dutiful and good)</span> to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship,)</span> Mujahid said: \"The hardship of bearing the child.\" Qatadah said: \"Exhaustion upon exhaustion.\" 'Ata' Al-Khurasani said: \"Weakness upon weakness.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَفِصَالُهُ فِي عَامَيْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and his weaning is in two years)</span> means, after he is born, he is breastfed and weaned within two years. This is like the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْوَالِدَاتُ يُرْضِعْنَ أَوْلَادَهُنَّ حَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ ۖ لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُتِمَّ الرَّضَاعَةَ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, for those who desire to complete the term of suckling)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:233)</span>. On this basis, Ibn 'Abbas and other Imams understood that the shortest possible period of pregnancy was six months, because Allah says elsewhere:</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">وَحَمْلُهُ وَفِصَالُهُ ثَلَاثُونَ شَهْرًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and the bearing of him, and the weaning of him is thirty months)</span><span class=\"gray\">(46:15)</span>. Allah mentions how the mother brings the child up, and how she gets tired and suffers stress from staying up with the child night and day, to remind the son of her previous kind treatment of him. This is like the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَقُلْ رَبِّ ارْحَمْهُمَا كَمَا رَبَّيَانِي صَغِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and say: \"My Lord! Bestow on them Your mercy as they did bring me up when I was young.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:24)</span>. Allah says here:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنِ اشْكُرْ لِي وَلِوَالِدَيْكَ إِلَيَّ الْمَصِيرُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination.)</span> means, 'I will reward you most generously for that.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنْ جَاهَدَاكَ عَلَىٰ أَنْ تُشْرِكَ بِي مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ فَلَا تُطِعْهُمَا ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But if they strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not;)</span> means, if they try hard to make you follow them in their religion, then do not accept that from them, but do not let that stop you from behaving with them in the world kindly, i.e. treating them with respect.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ مَنْ أَنَابَ إِلَيَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience.)</span> means, the believers.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ إِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do.)</span> At-Tabarani recorded in Al-'Ishrah that Sa'd bin Malik said, \"This Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنْ جَاهَدَاكَ عَلَىٰ أَنْ تُشْرِكَ بِي مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ فَلَا تُطِعْهُمَا ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But if they strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not;)</span> was revealed concerning me. I was a man who honored his mother, but when I became Muslim, she said: 'O Sa'd! What is this new thing I see you doing? Leave this religion of yours, or I will not eat or drink until I die, and people will say: Shame on you, for what you have done to me, and they will say that you have killed your mother.' I said, 'Do not do that, O mother, for I will not give up this religion of mine for anything.' She stayed without eating for one day and one night, and she became exhausted; then she stayed for another day and night without eating, and she became utterly exhausted. When I saw that, I said: 'O my mother, by Allah, even if you had one hundred souls and they were to depart one by one, I would not give up this religion of mine for anything, so if you want to, eat, and if you want to, do not eat.' So she ate.\"</p>"
