This is the issue of children who die when they are little, and their parents are disbelievers: what happens to them By the same token, what happens to the insane, the deaf, the senile and those who die during the circumstances of Fatrah, when no Message reached them? Several Hadiths have been narrated on this topic, which I will quote here by the help and support of Allah.</p><p lang=\"yo\" class=\"yo \">The First Hadith from Al-Aswad bin Sari</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad reported from Al-Aswad bin Sari' that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَرْبَعَةٌ يَحْتَجُّونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ: رَجُلٌ أَصَمُّ لَا يَسْمَعُ شَيْئًا، وَرَجُلٌ أَحْمَقُ، وَرَجُلٌ هَرِمٌ، وَرَجُلٌ مَاتَ فِي فَتْرَةٍ، فَأَمَّا الْأَصَمُّ فَيَقُولُ: رَبِّ قَدْ جَاءَ الْإِسْلَامُ وَمَا أَسْمَعُ شَيْئًا، وَأَمَّا الْأَحْمَقُ فَيَقُولُ: رَبِّ قَدْ جَاءَ الْإِسْلَامُ وَالصِّبْيَانُ يَحْذِفُونِي بِالْبَعْرِ، وَأَمَّا الْهَرِمُ فَيَقُولُ: رَبِّ لَقَدْ جَاءَ الْإِسْلَامُ وَمَا أَعْقِلُ شَيْئًا، وَأَمَّا الَّذِي مَاتَ فِي الْفَتْرَةِ فَيَقُولُ: رَبِّ مَا أَتَانِي لَكَ رَسُولٌ. فَيَأْخُذُ مَوَاثِيقَهُمْ لِيُطِيعَنَّهُ، فَيُرْسِلُ إِلَيْهِمْ أَنِ ادْخُلُوا النَّارَ، فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسُ مُحَمَّدٍ بِيَدِهِ، لَوْ دَخَلُوهَا لَكَانَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ بَرْدًا وَسَلَامًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There are four who will present their case on the Day of Resurrection: a deaf man who never heard anything, an insane man, a very old and senile man, and a man who died during the Fatrah. As for the deaf man, he will say, \"O Lord, Islam came but I never heard anything.\" As for the insane man, he will say, \"O Lord, Islam came and the young boys were throwing camel dung at me.\" As for the senile man, he will say, \"O Lord, Islam came and I did not understand anything.\" As for the one who died during the Fatrah, he will say, \"O Lord, no Messenger from You came to me.\" Allah will accept their pledge of obedience to Him, then He will send word to them that they should enter the Fire. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, if they enter it, it will be cool and safe for them.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There is a similar report with a chain from Qatadah from Al-Hasan from Abu Rafi' from Abu Hurayrah, but at the end it says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمَنْ دَخَلَهَا كَانَتْ عَلَيْهِ بَرْدًا وَسَلَامًا، وَمَنْ لَمْ يَدْخُلْهَا يُسْحَبُ إِلَيْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever enters it will find it cool and safe, and whoever does not enter it will be dragged into it.)</span> This was also recorded by Ishaq bin Rahwayh from Mu'adh bin Hisham, and by Al-Bayhaqi in Al-I'tiqad. He said: \"This is a Sahih chain.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was reported by Ibn Jarir from the Hadith of Ma'mar from Hammam from Abu Hurayrah, who attributed it to the Prophet ﷺ. Then Abu Hurayrah said: \"Recite, if you wish:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّىٰ نَبْعَثَ رَسُولًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger <span class=\"gray\">(to give warning)</span>)</span>.\" This was also narrated by Ma'mar from 'Abdullah bin Tawus from his father, from Abu Hurayrah, but it is Mauquf <span class=\"gray\">(it was not attributed directly to the Prophet ﷺ)</span>.</p><div lang=\"fil\" class=\"fil \"><h2>The Second Hadith from Abu Hurayrah</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى الْفِطْرَةِ، فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ أَوْ يُنَصِّرَانِهِ أَوْ يُمَجِّسَانِهِ، كَمَا تُنْتِجُ الْبَهِيمَةُ بَهِيمَةً جَمْعَاءَ، هَلْ تُحِسُّونَ فِيهَا مِنْ جَدْعَاءَ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Every newborn is born in a state of Fitrah <span class=\"gray\">(the natural state of man)</span>, then his parents make him into a Jew or Christian or Zoroastrian, as animals produce whole animals - do you see any that is born mutilated <span class=\"gray\">(with something missing)</span>?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">According to one report they said: \"O Messenger of Allah, what about those who die when they are little\" He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا كَانُوا عَامِلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah knows best what they would have done.)</span> Imam Ahmad reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet ﷺ as far as I know - the narrator was not sure if it was attributed to Musa - said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَرَارِيُّ الْمُسْلِمِينَ فِي الْجَنَّةِ يَكْفُلُهُمْ إِبْرَاهِيمُ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The children of the Muslims are in Paradise, being taken care of by Ibrahim.)</span> In Sahih Muslim it is reported from 'Iyyad bin Hammad that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said that Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنِّي خَلَقْتُ عِبَادِي حُنَفَاءَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I have created My servants as Hunafa.)</span> According to another version, the wording is \"as Muslims.\"</p><div lang=\"sn\" class=\"sn \"><h2>The Third Hadith from Samurah</h2></div><p lang=\"sl\" class=\"sl \">In his book Al-Mustakhraj 'Ala Al-Bukhari, Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Barqani recorded the Hadith of 'Awf Al-A'rabi, from Abu Raja' Al-'Utardi from Samurah that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى الْفِطْرَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Every newborn is born in a state of Fitrah.)</span> The people called out to him: \"O Messenger of Allah! What about the children of the idolators?\" He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَوْلَادُ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the children of the idolators too.)</span> At-Tabarani reported that Samurah said: \"We asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the children of the idolators, and he said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هُمْ خَدَمُ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They are the servants of the people of Paradise.)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Fourth Hadith from the Paternal Uncle of Hasna</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ahmad reported that Hasna' bint Mu'awiyah, from Bani Suraym, said that his paternal uncle said to him: \"I said, 'O Messenger of Allah, who is in Paradise?' He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">النَّبِيُّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَالشَّهِيدُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَالْمَوْلُودُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَالْوَئِيدُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Prophets are in Paradise, martyrs are in Paradise, infants are in Paradise and baby girls who were buried alive are in Paradise.)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>It is Makruh to discuss this Matter</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In order to discuss this issue we need good, sound proof, but people who have no knowledge of Shari'ah may try to speak about it. For this reason some of the scholars did not like to discuss it. This view has been narrated from Ibn 'Abbas, Al-Qasim bin Muhammad bin Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah and others.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Hibban recorded in his Sahih that Jarir bin Hazim said: I heard Abu Raja' Al-'Utardi saying that he heard Ibn 'Abbas <span class=\"gray\">(may Allah be pleased with them both)</span> saying, \"While he was on the Minbar, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا يَزَالُ أَمْرُ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ مُوَاتِيًا - أَوْ مُقَارِبَا - مَالَمْ يَتَكَلَّمُوا فِي الْوِلْدَانِ وَالْقَدَرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(This Ummah will be fine so long as they do not talk about children and the divine decree.)</span>\" Ibn Hibban said: \"This means talking about the children of the idolators.\" Abu Bakr Al-Bazzar also recorded it via Jarir bin Hazim, then he said, \"A group narrated it from Abu Raja' from Ibn 'Abbas, but it is Mauquf\".</p>"
