Verily, you are criminals <span>(46)</span>Woe that Day to the deniers <span>(47)</span>And when it is said to them: \"Bow down yourself!\" They bow not down <span>(48)</span>Woe that Day to the deniers <span>(49)</span>Then in what statement after this will they believe <span>(50)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Final Abode for Those Who have Taqwa</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah informs that His servants who have Taqwa and worship Him by performing the obligations and abandoning the forbidden things, will be in gardens and springs on the Day of Judgement. This means they will be in the opposite condition of the wretched people, who will be in shades of Al-Yahmum, which is purtrid, black smoke. Allah says,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَفَوَاكِهَ مِمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And fruits, such as they desire.)</span> meaning, and from other types of fruits, they will have whatever they request.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا هَنِيئًا بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Eat and drink comfortably for that which you used to do.)</span> meaning, this will be said to them out of kindness for them. Reestablishing what He has previously mentioned, Allah says;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّا كَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الْمُحْسِنِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, thus We reward the Muhsinin.)</span> meaning, 'this is Our reward for whoever does good deeds.'</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِلْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Woe that Day to the deniers!)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">A Threat for Whoever denies the Day of Judgement</p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُوا وَتَمَتَّعُوا قَلِيلًا إِنَّكُمْ مُجْرِمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little while. Verily, you are criminals.)</span> This is an address to the deniers of the Day of Judgement. It is commanding them with a command of threat and intimidation. Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُوا وَتَمَتَّعُوا قَلِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little while.)</span> meaning, for a period of time that is short, small and brief.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّكُمْ مُجْرِمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, you are criminals.)</span> meaning, then you all will be driven to the fire of Hell which has already been mentioned.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِلْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Woe that Day to the deniers!)</span> This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نُمَتِّعُهُمْ قَلِيلًا ثُمَّ نَضْطَرُّهُمْ إِلَىٰ عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We let them enjoy for a little while, then in the end We shall oblige them to a great torment.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(31:24)</span> Allah also says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ لَا يُفْلِحُونَ - مَتَاعٌ فِي الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ الْعَذَابَ الشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْفُرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, those who invent a lie against Allah, will never be successsful. <span class=\"gray\">(A brief)</span> enjoyment in this world! And then unto Us will be their return, then We shall make them taste the severest torment because they used to disbelieve.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(10:69,70)</span> Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ ارْكَعُوا لَا يَرْكَعُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when it is said to them: \"Bow down yourself!\" They bow not down.)</span> meaning, when these ignorant disbelievers are ordered to pray with the congregation <span class=\"gray\">(of believers)</span>, they refuse and turn away from it arrogantly. Thus, Allah says,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِلْمُكَذِّبِينَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Woe that Day to the deniers!)</span> Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَبِأَيِّ حَدِيثٍ بَعْدَهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then in what statement after this will they believe?)</span> meaning, if they do not believe in this Qur'an, then what talk will they believe in? This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَبِأَيِّ حَدِيثٍ بَعْدَ اللَّهِ وَآيَاتِهِ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then in which speech after Allah and His Ayat will they believe?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(45: 6)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Mursalat, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah. He is the Giver of success and security.</p>"
