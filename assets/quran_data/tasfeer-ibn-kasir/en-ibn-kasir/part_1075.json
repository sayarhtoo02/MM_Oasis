Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَنذَرْتُكُمْ نَارًا تَلَظَّىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Therefore I have warned you of a Fire Talazza.)</span></p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">Mujahid said, \"Blazing.\" Imam Ahmad recorded from Simak bin Harb that he heard An-Nu'man bin Bashir giving a sermon, in which he said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ giving a sermon, in which he said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنْذَرْتُكُمُ النَّارَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I have warned you of the Fire.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And he said it in such a voice that if a man was in the marketplace he could hear it from where I am standing now. And he said it <span class=\"gray\">(with such force)</span> that the garment that was on his shoulder fell down to his feet.\"</p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Ishaq that he heard An-Nu'man bin Bashir giving a sermon, in which he said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ أَهْوَنَ أَهْلِ النَّارِ عَذَابًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ رَجُلٌ تُوضَعُ فِي أَخْمَصِ قَدَمَيْهِ جَمْرَتَانِ يَغْلِي مِنْهُمَا دِمَاغُهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the person to be punished lightest of the people of the Fire on the Day of Judgement will be a man who will have placed on the soles of his feet two coals that will cause his brain to boil.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Al-Bukhari also recorded this narration. Muslim recorded that Abu Ishaq narrated from An-Nu'man bin Bashir that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">إِنَّ أَهْوَنَ أَهْلِ النَّارِ عَذَابًا مَنْ لَهُ نَعْلَانِ وَشِرَاكَانِ مِنْ نَارٍ يَغْلِي مِنْهُمَا دِمَاغُهُ كَمَا يَغْلِي الْمِرْجَلُ، مَا يَرَى أَنَّ أَحَدًا أَشَدُّ مِنْهُ عَذَابًا، وَإِنَّهُ لَأَهْوَنُهُمْ عَذَابًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the lightest punishment received by the people of the Hellfire will be a man who will have two sandals whose straps will be made of fire that will cause his brain to boil just as a cauldron boils. Yet he will not think that anyone is receiving a torment more severe than him, even though he will be receiving the lightest punishment of them.)</span></p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا يَصْلَاهَا إِلَّا الْأَشْقَى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(None shall enter it save the most wretched.)</span> meaning, none will enter surrounded by it on all sides except the most wretched. Then Allah explains who this <span class=\"gray\">(the most wretched)</span> is by His saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِي كَذَّبَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who denies)</span> meaning, in his heart.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَوَلَّىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and turns away.)</span> meaning, from acting with his limbs and performing deeds according to their pillars.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُّ أُمَّتِي يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّـةَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ إِلَّا مَنْ أَبَى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(All of my followers will enter Paradise on the Day of Judgement except for whoever refuses.)</span> They <span class=\"gray\">(the Companions)</span> said, \"Who would refuse, O Messenger of Allah?\" He replied,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ أَطَاعَنِي دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ، وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَقَدْ أَبَى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever obeys me, he will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys me, then he has refused.)</span> Al-Bukhari also recorded this Hadith.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَسَيُجَنَّبُهَا الْأَتْقَى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those with Taqwa will be far removed from it.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, the righteous, pure, most pious person will be saved from the Fire. Then He explains who he is by His saying,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">الَّذِي يُؤْتِي مَالَهُ يَتَزَكَّىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He who gives of his wealth for self-purification.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, he spends his wealth in obedience of his Lord in order to purify himself, his wealth and whatever Allah has bestowed upon him of religion and worldly things.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا لِأَحَدٍ عِندَهُ مِن نِّعْمَةٍ تُجْزَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And who has <span class=\"gray\">(in mind)</span> no favor from anyone to be paid back.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, giving his wealth is not done so that he may gain some favor from someone wherein they return some good to him, and therefore he gives to get something in return. He only spends his wealth</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">ابْتِغَاءَ وَجْهِ رَبِّهِ الْأَعْلَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(to seek the Face of his Lord, the Most High)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, hoping to attain the blessing of seeing Him in the final abode in the Gardens of Paradise. Allah then says,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَلَسَوْفَ يَرْضَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He, surely, will be pleased.)</span> meaning, indeed those with these characteristics will be pleased.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Cause of this Revelation and the Virtue of Abu Bakr</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Many of the scholars of Tafsir have mentioned that these Ayat were revealed about Abu Bakr As-Siddiq. Some of them even mentioned that there is a consensus among the Qur'anic commentators concerning this. There is no doubt that he is included in the meaning of these Ayat, and that he is the most deserving of the Ummah to be described with these characteristics in general, for indeed, the wording of these Ayat is general. As in Allah's saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَسَيُجَنَّبُهَا الْأَتْقَى - الَّذِي يُؤْتِي مَالَهُ يَتَزَكَّىٰ - وَمَا لِأَحَدٍ عِندَهُ مِن نِّعْمَةٍ تُجْزَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those with Taqwa will be far removed from it. He who gives of his wealth for self-purification. And who has <span class=\"gray\">(in mind)</span> no favor from anyone to be paid back.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">However, he <span class=\"gray\">(Abu Bakr)</span> was the first and foremost of this Ummah to have all of these characteristics and other praiseworthy characteristics as well. For verily, he was truthful, pious, generous, charitable, and he always spent his wealth in obedience of His Master <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span> and in aiding the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. How many Dirhams and Dinars did he spend seeking the Face of His Most Noble Lord. And did not consider any of the people as owning him some favor that he needed to get compensation for. Rather, his virtue and kindness was even shown towards leaders and chiefs from all the other tribes as well. This is why 'Urwah bin Mas'ud, who was the chief of the Thaqif tribe, said to him on the day of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, \"By Allah, if I did not owe you a debt, which I have not paid you back for, I would have responded to you <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., your call to Islam)</span>.\" Abu Bakr As-Siddiq became angry with him for saying such a thing <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., I owe you something)</span>. So if this was his position with the chiefs of the Arabs and the heads of the tribes, then what about those other than them. Thus, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا لِأَحَدٍ عِندَهُ مِن نِّعْمَةٍ تُجْزَىٰ - إِلَّا ابْتِغَاءَ وَجْهِ رَبِّهِ الْأَعْلَىٰ - وَلَسَوْفَ يَرْضَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And who has <span class=\"gray\">(in mind)</span> no favor from anyone to be paid back. Except to seek the Face of his Lord, the Most High. He, surely, will be pleased.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And in the Two Sahihs it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ أَنْفَقَ زَوْجَيْنِ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ دَعَتْهُ خَزَنَةُ الْجَنَّةِ يَاعَبْدَ اللهِ، هَذَا خَيْرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever equipped two riding animals in the way of Allah, the Gatekeepers of Paradise will call to him saying, \"O servant of Allah! This is good.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So Abu Bakr said, \"O Messenger of Allah! The one who is called from them will not have any need. Will there be anyone who will be called from all of them?\" The Prophet ﷺ replied,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">نَعَمْ، وَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِنْهُم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yes, and I hope that you will be one of them.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Layl, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>"
