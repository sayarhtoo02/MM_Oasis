The point here is that Allah is telling us that He gave guidance to Ibrahim aforetime, i.e., He had already guided him at an early age.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكُنَّا بِهِ عَالِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and We were Well-Acquainted with him.)</span> means, and he was worthy of that.

Ibrahim said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا هَٰذِهِ التَّمَاثِيلُ الَّتِي أَنتُمْ لَهَا عَاكِفُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"What are these images, to which you are devoted?\")</span> meaning, which you worship with such devotion.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالُوا وَجَدْنَا آبَاءَنَا لَهَا عَابِدِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They said: \"We found our fathers worshipping them.\")</span> means, they had no other evidence apart from the misguided actions of their forefathers.

They had a festival which they would go out to celebrate. Abu Ishaq reported from Abu Al-Ahwas from 'Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud, \"When the people of Ibrahim went out to celebrate their festival, they passed by him and said, 'O Ibrahim, are you not coming out with us' He said, 'I am sick.'\" It was only the day before that he had said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَاللَّهِ لَأَكِيدَنَّ أَصْنَامَكُم بَعْدَ أَن تُوَلُّوا مُدْبِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And by Allah, I shall plot a plan for your idols after you have gone away and turned your backs.)</span> and some of the people had heard him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَجَعَلَهُمْ جُذَاذًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So he broke them to pieces,)</span> means, he smashed them all, except for the biggest idol.

For you are indeed my sister according to the Book of Allah, and there are no Muslims on the earth apart from you and I.\" So Ibrahim brought her to him, then he stood and prayed. When she entered upon the tyrant, he reached for her desirously once he saw her. But he suffered a severe seizure. So he said, \"Pray to Allah for me and I will not harm you.\" So she prayed for him and it released him. Then he reached for her desirously, but he was stricken similarly before or worse. This continued three times, and each time he said the same as he had said the first time. Then he called the closest of his guards and said, \"You have not brought me a human being, you have brought me a devil! Take her out and give her Hajar. So she was taken out and given Hajar, and she went back. When Ibrahim realized that she had come back, he finished his prayer and turned around. He said, \"What happened?\" She said, \"Allah took care of the evil disbeliever's plot, and he gave me Hajar as a servant.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Muhammad bin Sirin said, \"When Abu Hurayrah narrated this Hadith, he said, 'This is your mother, O sons of the water of the heaven.'\"</p>"
