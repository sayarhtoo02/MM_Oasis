He has given them the day with its light, so that they can undertake their journeys and engage in their business.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى النَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَشْكُرُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Truly, Allah is full of bounty to mankind; yet, most of mankind give no thanks.)</span> means, they do not express gratitude for the favors which Allah bestows upon them.
