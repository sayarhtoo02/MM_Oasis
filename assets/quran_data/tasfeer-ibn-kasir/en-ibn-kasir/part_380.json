It was said that Allah mentioned this ruling again here because it is connected to whatever is before and whatever is after it. Hence, Allah first said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَدْ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَاءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَةً تَرْضَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, We have seen the turning of your <span class=\"gray\">(Muhammad's)</span> face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah <span class=\"gray\">(prayer direction)</span> that shall please you)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:144)</span>, until:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Certainly, the people who were given the Scripture <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., Jews and the Christians)</span> know well that, that <span class=\"gray\">(your turning towards the direction of the Ka'bah at Makkah in prayers)</span> is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:144)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah mentioned in these Ayat His fulfillment of the Prophet's wish and ordered him to face the Qiblah that he liked and is pleased with. In the second command, Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنْ حَيْثُ خَرَجْتَ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَإِنَّهُ لَلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And from wheresoever you start forth <span class=\"gray\">(for prayers)</span>, turn your face in the direction of Al-Masid Al-Haram that is indeed the truth from your Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, Allah states here that changing the Qiblah is also the truth from Him, thus upgrading the subject more than in the first Ayah, in which Allah agreed to what His Prophet ﷺ had wished for. Thus Allah states that this is also the truth from Him that He likes and is pleased with. In the third command, Allah refutes the Jewish assertion that the Prophet faced their Qiblah ﷺ, as they knew in their Books that the Prophet ﷺ will later on be commanded to face the Qiblah of Ibrahim, the Ka'bah. The Arab disbelievers had no more argument concerning the Prophet's Qiblah after Allah commanded the Prophet ﷺ to face the Qiblah of Ibrahim, which is more respected and honored, rather than the Qiblah of the Jews. The Arabs used to honor the Ka'bah and liked the fact that the Messenger ﷺ was commanded to face it.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Wisdom behind abrogating the Previous Qiblah</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَيْكُمْ حُجَّةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...so that men may have no argument against you)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, the People of the Book knew from the description of the Muslim Ummah that they would be ordered to face the Ka'bah. If the Muslims did not fit this description, the Jews would have used this fact against the Muslims. If the Muslims had remained on the Qiblah of Bayt Al-Maqdis, which was also the Qiblah of the Jews, this fact could have been used as the basis of argument by the Jews against other people.</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's Statement:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِلَّا الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا مِنْهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...except those of them that are wrongdoers,)</span> indicates the Mushrikin <span class=\"gray\">(polytheists)</span> of Quraysh. The reasoning of these unjust persons was the unsound statement: \"This man <span class=\"gray\">(Muhammad)</span> claims that he follows the religion of Ibrahim! Hence, if his facing Bayt Al-Maqdis was a part of the religion of Ibrahim, why did he change it?\" The answer to this question is that Allah has chosen His Prophet ﷺ to face Bayt Al-Maqdis first for certain wisdom, and he obeyed Allah regarding this command. Then, Allah changed the Qiblah to the Qiblah of Ibrahim, which is the Ka'bah, and he also obeyed Allah in this command. He, obeys Allah in all cases and never engages in the defiance of Allah even for an instant, and his Ummah imitates him in this.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَاخْشَوْنِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...so fear them not, but fear Me!)</span> meaning: 'Do not fear the doubts that the unjust, stubborn persons raise and fear Me Alone.' Indeed, Allah Alone deserves to be feared.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَلِأُتِمَّ نِعْمَتِي عَلَيْكُمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...so that I may complete My blessings on you.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Ayah relates to Allah's statement:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَيْكُمْ حُجَّةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...so that men may have no argument against you)</span>, meaning: I will perfect My bounty on you by legislating for you to face the Ka'bah, so that the <span class=\"gray\">(Islamic)</span> Shari'ah <span class=\"gray\">(law)</span> is complete in every respect. Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...that you may be guided.)</span>, meaning: 'To be directed and guided to what the nations have been led astray from, We have guided you to it and preferred you with it.' This is why this Ummah is the best and most honored nation ever.</p>"
