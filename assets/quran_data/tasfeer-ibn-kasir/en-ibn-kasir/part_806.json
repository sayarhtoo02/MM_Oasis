Allah said:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَمِنْ دُونِهِمَا جَنَّتَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And below these two, there are two other Gardens.)</span> We previously mentioned the Hadith stating that there are two gardens made of gold, their vessels and all they contain, and there are two gardens made of silver, their vessels and all they contain. The first two are for the near believers <span class=\"gray\">(Muqarribin)</span> and the latter two are for those on the right <span class=\"gray\">(Ashab Al-Yamin)</span>. Abu Musa commented, \"There are two gardens made of gold for the Muqarribin and two gardens made of silver for Ashab Al-Yamin.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There are several proofs that the former two gardens in Paradise are better in grade than the latter. Allah mentioned the former two gardens before the latter two, thus indicating their significance, then He said,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَمِنْ دُونِهِمَا جَنَّتَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And below these two, there are two other Gardens.)</span> And this is an obvious form of honoring the first two gardens over the latter two. Allah described the former gardens:</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">ذَوَاتَا أَفْنَانٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(With Afnān)</span>, which are the extending branches, as we explained, or various types of delights. But He said about the latter two gardens,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">مُدْهَامَّتَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Mudhāmmatān)</span>, being dark, because of the intense irrigation. Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Mudhāmmatān means, they have become dark green because of extensive water irrigation.\" Muhammad bin Ka'b said:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">مُدْهَامَّتَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Mudhāmmatān)</span> \"Full of greenery.\" There is no doubt that the former two gardens are better, their branches are fresh, youthful and intermingling. Allah said about the former two gardens,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِيهِمَا عَيْنَانِ تَجْرِيَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In them <span class=\"gray\">(both)</span> will be two springs flowing <span class=\"gray\">(free)</span>)</span>, while He said about the springs of the latter two gardens,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\"> نَضَّاخَتَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Naddakhatan)</span>; 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn 'Abbas: \"It means gushing. And the free flowing is stronger than gushing.\" Ad-Dahhak said that,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\"> نَضَّاخَتَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(gushing forth)</span> means, they are full of water and constantly gushing. Allah said about the former two gardens,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِيهِمَا مِنْ كُلِّ فَاكِهَةٍ زَوْجَانِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In them <span class=\"gray\">(both)</span> will be every kind of fruit in pairs)</span>, but He said about the latter two gardens,<span class=\"gray\">(55:52)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِيهِمَا فَاكِهَةٌ وَنَخْلٌ وَرُمَّانٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In them <span class=\"gray\">(both)</span> will be fruits, and date palms and pomegranates.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There is no doubt that the first description is better and refers to more of a variety and more types of fruit. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah said about the latter two gardens, Allah then said;</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">فِيهِنَّ خَيْرَاتٌ حِسَانٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Therein will be Khayrat Hisan;)</span> meaning, there are various types of good and delightful things in these two gardens in Paradise, according to Qatadah. It was also said that Khayrat is plural of Khayrah and it is a righteous, well-mannered, beautiful woman, according to the majority of scholars, and it is also reported from Umm Salamah as a Hadith from the Prophet ﷺ. There is another Hadith saying that Al-Hur Al-'Ayn will sing,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نَحْنُ الْخَيْرَاتُ الْحِسَانُ، خُلِقْنَا لِأَزْوَاجٍ كِرَامٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"We are Al-Khayrat Al-Hisan, we were created for honorable husbands.\")</span> Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حُورٌ مَقْصُورَاتٌ فِي الْخِيَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Hūr <span class=\"gray\">(beautiful, fair females)</span> guarded in pavilions;)</span> but He said about the first two gardens,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِيهِنَّ قَاصِرَاتُ الطَّرْفِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Wherein both will be Qaşirāt Aṭ-Ṭarf,)</span><span class=\"gray\">(55:56)</span>There is no doubt that the chaste wives that restrain their glances themselves, are better than those guarded in pavilions even though both are secluded. About Allah's saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِي الْخِيَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(in pavilions;)</span> Al-Bukhari recorded that 'Abdullah bin Qays said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ خَيْمَةً مِنْ لُؤْلُؤَةٍ مُجَوَّفَةٍ، عَرْضُهَا سِتُّونَ مِيلًا، فِي كُلِّ زَاوِيَةٍ مِنْهَا أَهْلٌ، مَا يَرَوْنَ الْاخَرِينَ يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, in Paradise, the believer will have a tent from a hollow pearl, the width thereof is sixty miles. In each corner of it there are wives for the believer that do not see the other wives, and the believer will visit them all.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In another narration the Prophet ﷺ said that this tent is thirty miles wide. Muslim recorded this Hadith and in his narration, the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ لِلْمُؤْمِنِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لَخَيْمَةً مِنْ لُؤْلُؤَةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ مُجَوَّفَةٍ، طُولُهَا سِتُّونَ مِيلًا، لِلْمُؤْمِنِ فِيهَا أَهْلٌ يَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمُؤْمِنُ فَلَا يَرَىٰ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily in Paradise, the believer will have a tent made of a hollow pearl the length thereof being sixty miles. In it, the believer will have wives who do not see each other, and the believer will visit them all.)</span> Allah the Exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنْسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلَا جَانٌّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whom never were deflowered by a human before nor Jinn.)</span> We explained this meaning before. Allah added in the description of the first group of the believers' wives,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَأَنَّهُنَّ الْيَاقُوتُ وَالْمَرْجَانُ - فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(they are like Yaqut <span class=\"gray\">(rubies)</span> and Marjan <span class=\"gray\">(pearls)</span>. Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(55:58-59)</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مُتَّكِئِينَ عَلَىٰ رَفْرَفٍ خُضْرٍ وَعَبْقَرِيٍّ حِسَانٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Reclining on green Rafraf and rich beautiful 'Abqariy.)</span> 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn 'Abbas: \"Rafraf means cushions.\" Mujahid, 'Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others also said that Rafraf means cushions. Al-'Ala' bin Badr said: \"The Rafraf are arrayed hanging over the couches.\" Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَعَبْقَرِيٍّ حِسَانٍ</p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \"><span class=\"gray\">(and rich beautiful 'Abqariy.)</span> Ibn 'Abbas, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi said that 'Abqariy means rich carpets. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">تَبَارَكَ اسْمُ رَبِّكَ ذِي الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Blessed be the Name of your Lord <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span> Dhil-Jalal wal-Ikram,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah states that He is Worthy of being honored and always obeyed, revered and thus worshipped, appreciated and never unappreciated, and remembered and never forgotten. 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas said that,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذِي الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Dhil-Jalal wal-Ikram)</span> means, the Owner of greatness and pride. In a Hadith, the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ مِنْ إِجْلَالِ اللهِ إِكْرَامُ ذِي الشَّيْبَةِ الْمُسْلِمِ، وَذِي السُّلْطَانِ، وَحَامِلِ الْقُرْآنِ غَيْرِ الْغَالِي فِيهِ، وَلَا الْجَافِي عَنْهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, among the acts of venerating Allah, are honoring the elderly Muslims, the one in authority, and carrier <span class=\"gray\">(memorizer)</span> of the Qur'an who avoids extremism and laziness with it.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Rabi'ah bin 'Amir said that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلِظُّوا بِذِي الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Persist <span class=\"gray\">(in invoking Allah)</span> with, \"Ya Dhal-Jalal wal-Ikram <span class=\"gray\">(O Owner of greatness and honor)</span>.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">An-Nasa'i also collected this Hadith. Muslim and the Four Sunan compilers recorded that 'A'ishah said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would <span class=\"gray\">(say the)</span> Salam <span class=\"gray\">(completing prayer)</span>, he would only sit as long as it takes him to say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللّٰهُمَّ أَنْتَ السَّلَامُ وَمِنْكَ السَّلَامُ، تَبَارَكْتَ يَاذَا الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Allah! You are As-Salam, and peace comes from You. Blessed be You Ya Dhal-Jalal wal-Ikram.)</span>.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Ar-Rahman, all praise is due to Allah and all favors come from Him.</p>"
