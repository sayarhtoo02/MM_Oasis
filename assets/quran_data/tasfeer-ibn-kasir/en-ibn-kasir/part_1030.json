Every person will know what he has brought.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">What will happen on the Day of Judgement, and that is the rolling up of the Sun</p><p lang=\"yo\" class=\"yo \">Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn 'Abbas:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When the sun is Kuwwirat.)</span> \"This means it will be darkened.\" Al-'Awfi reported from Ibn 'Abbas; \"It will go away.\" Qatadah said, \"Its light will go away.\" Sa'id bin Jubayr said, \"Kuwwirat means it will sink in.\" Abu Salih said, \"Kuwwirat means it will be thrown down.\" At-Takwir means to gather one part of something with another part of it <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., folding)</span>. From it comes the folding of the turban <span class=\"gray\">('Imamah)</span> and the folding of clothes together. Thus, the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">كُوِّرَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Kuwwirat)</span> is that part of it will be folded up into another part of it. Then it will be rolled up and thrown away. When this is done to it, its light will go away. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ يُكَوَّرَانِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The sun and the moon will be rolled up on the Day of Judgement.)</span> Al-Bukhari was alone in recording this Hadith and this is his wording of it.</p><p lang=\"no\" class=\"no \">Dispersing the Stars</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when the stars Inkadarat.)</span> meaning, when they are scattered. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(82:2)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The basis of the word Inkidar is Insibab, which means to be poured out. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ar-Rabi' bin Anas reported from Abu Al-'Aliyah, who reported from Ubayy bin Ka'b that he said, \"Six signs will take place before the Day of Judgement. The people will be in their marketplaces when the sun's light will go away. When they are in that situation, the stars will be scattered. When they are in that situation, the mountains will fall down upon the face of the earth, and the earth will move, quake and be in a state of mixed up confusion. So the Jinns will then flee in fright to the humans and the humans will flee to the Jinns. The domestic beasts, birds and wild animals will mix together, and they will surge together in a wave <span class=\"gray\">(of chaos)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا الْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when the wild beasts are gathered together.)</span> This means they will be mixed.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا الْعِشَارُ عُطِّلَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when the pregnant she camels are neglected;)</span> This means their owners will neglect them.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا الْبِحَارُ سُجِّرَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when the seas become as blazing fire)</span>\" Then he <span class=\"gray\">(Ubayy)</span> went on to say, \"The Jinns will say, 'We come to you with news.' So they will all go to the sea, and it will be a blazing fire. While they are in that state, the earth will be split with one huge crack that will extend from the lowest, seventh earth to the highest, seventh heaven. So while they are in that state, a wind will come that will kill all of them.\" Ibn Jarir recorded this narration with this wording.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Moving of the Mountains, abandoning of the Pregnant She-Camels, and the gathering of the Wild Beasts</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ سُيِّرَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when the mountains are made to pass away;)</span> meaning, they will not remain in their places and they will be destroyed. Then the earth will be left as a flat, level plain. Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا الْعِشَارُ عُطِّلَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when the pregnant she-camels <span class=\"gray\">('Ishar)</span> are neglected <span class=\"gray\">('Uttilat)</span>;)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ikrimah and Mujahid said, \"'Ishar are <span class=\"gray\">(pregnant she-)</span> camels.\" Mujahid said, \"'Uttilat means abandoned and left.\" Ubayy bin Ka'b and Ad-Dahhak both said, \"Their owners will neglect them.\" Ar-Rabi' bin Khuthaym said, \"They will not be milked or tied up. Their masters will leave them abandoned.\" Ad-Dahhak said, \"They will be left with no one to tend to them.\" And the meaning of all of these statements is similar. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">What is intended is that the 'Ishar is a type of camel. It is actually the best type of camel, and particularly the pregnant females of them when they have reached the tenth month of their pregnancies. One of them is singularly referred to as 'Ushara', and she keeps that name until she gives birth. So the people will be too busy to tend to her, take care of her or benefit from her, after she used to be the most important thing to them. This will be due to what will suddenly overtake them of the great, terrifying and horrible situation. This is the matter of the Day of Judgement, the coming together of its causes, and the occurrence of those things that will happen before it.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا الْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when the wild beasts are gathered together.)</span> meaning, gathered. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا طَائِرٍ يَطِيرُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ إِلَّا أُمَمٌ أَمْثَالُكُم ۚ مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِي الْكِتَابِ مِن شَيْءٍ ۚ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is not a moving creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they shall be gathered.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:38)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Everything will be gathered, even the flies.\" This statement was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Allah also says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالطَّيْرَ مَحْشُورَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And <span class=\"gray\">(so did)</span> the birds assembled.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(38:19)</span> meaning, gathered.</p><p lang=\"lt\" class=\"lt \">The Blazing of the Seas</p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا الْبِحَارُ سُجِّرَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when the seas become as blazing fire.)</span> Ibn Jarir recorded from Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib that 'Ali said to a Jewish man, \"Where is the Hell?\" The man said, \"The sea.\" 'Ali then said, \"I think he is truthful, as Allah says</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْبَحْرِ الْمَسْجُورِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And by the seas kindled <span class=\"gray\">(Masjur)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(52:6)</span> and;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا الْبِحَارُ سُجِّرَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when the seas become as blazing fire.)</span>\" This has already been discussed previously with the explanation of Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْبَحْرِ الْمَسْجُورِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And by the seas kindled <span class=\"gray\">(Masjur)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(52:6)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Joining the Souls</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا النُّفُوسُ زُوِّجَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when the souls are joined with their mates.)</span> meaning, every type <span class=\"gray\">(of soul)</span> will be gathered with its peer <span class=\"gray\">(or mate)</span>. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">احْشُرُوا الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا وَأَزْوَاجَهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It will be said to the angels)</span>: \"Assemble those who did wrong, together with their companions <span class=\"gray\">(from the devils)</span>.) <span class=\"gray\">(37:22)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from An-Nu'man bin Bashir that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا النُّفُوسُ زُوِّجَتْ</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الضُّرَبَاءُ: كُلُّ رَجُلٍ مَعَ كُلِّ قَوْمٍ كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ عَمَلَهُ وَذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ يَقُولُ:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكُنتُمْ أَزْوَاجًا ثَلَاثَةً - فَأَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ - وَأَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ - وَالسَّابِقُونَ السَّابِقُونَ</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هُمُ الضُّرَبَاءُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(And When the souls are joined with their mates.)</span> Those who are alike.

Al-Maw'udah is the female infant that the people of the pre-Islamic time of ignorance would bury in the dirt due to their hatred of girls. Therefore, on the Day of Judgement, the female infant will be asked what sin she committed that caused here to be murdered. This will be a means of frightening her murderer. For verily, if the one who was wronged is questioned, what does the wrongdoer <span class=\"gray\">(the one who is guilty of the oppression)</span> think then? 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا الْمَوْءُودَةُ سُئِلَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when the female infant <span class=\"gray\">(Al-Maw'udah)</span> buried alive Su'ilat:)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"This means that she will ask.\" Abu Ad-Duha made a similar statement when he said, \"She will ask, meaning she will demand restitution for her blood.\" The same has been reported from As-Suddi and Qatadah. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Hadiths have been reported concerning the Maw'udah. Imam Ahmad recorded from 'A'ishah, who reported from Judamah bint Wahb, the sister of 'Ukkashah, that she said, \"I was in the presence of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ when he was with some people, and he said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَقَدْ هَمَمْتُ أَنْ أَنْهَى عَنِ الْغِيلَةِ فَنَظَرْتُ فِي الرُّومِ وَفَارِسَ، فَإِذَا هُمْ يُغِيلُونَ أَوْلَادَهُمْ، وَلَا يَضُرُّ أَوْلَادَهُمْ ذٰلِكَ شَيْئًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I was about to prohibit sexual relations with breast feeding women, but then I saw that the Romans and the Persians have sexual relations with their women who breast feed their children and it does not harm the children at all.)</span> Then they asked him about interruption of sexual intercourse to prevent the male discharge from entering the womb of the woman, and he said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَٰلِكَ الْوَأْدُ الْخَفِيُّ، وَهُوَ الْمَوْءُودَةُ سُئِلَت</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That is the minor infanticide and it is the female infant buried alive <span class=\"gray\">(Maw'udah)</span> that will be questioned.)</span>\" Muslim, Ibn Majah, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i, all recorded this Hadith as well.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Atonement for burying Infant Girls Alive</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abdur-Razzaq said that Isra'il informed them from Simak bin Harb, from An-Nu'man bin Bashir, who reported from 'Umar bin Al-Khattab that he said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا الْمَوْءُودَةُ سُئِلَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when the female infant buried alive is questioned.)</span> \"Qays bin 'Asim came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and said, 'O Messenger of Allah!
