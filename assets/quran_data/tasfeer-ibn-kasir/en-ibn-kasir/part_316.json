    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And We revealed to Musa, saying: \"Depart by night with My servants, verily, you will be pursued. <span>(52)</span>Then Fir'awn sent callers to <span class=\"gray\">(all)</span> the cities <span>(53)</span><span class=\"gray\">(Saying)</span>: \"Verily, these indeed are but a small band. <span>(54)</span>\"And verily, they have done what has enraged us. <span>(55)</span>\"But we are a host all assembled, amply forewarned. <span>(56)</span>So, We expelled them from gardens and springs <span>(57)</span>Treasures, and every kind of honorable place <span>(58)</span>Thus and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them <span>(59)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Exodus of the Children of Israel From Egypt</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">After Musa stayed in Egypt for a long time, and the proof of Allah was established against Fir'awn and his chiefs, yet they were still arrogant and stubborn, then there was nothing left for them but punishment and vengeance. So Allah commanded Musa, peace be upon him, to take the Children of Israel out of Egypt by night, and take them wherever he would be commanded. So Musa, peace be upon him, did as he was commanded by his Lord, may He be glorified, and he led them forth after they had borrowed an abundance of jewelry from the people of Fir'awn. As more than one of the scholars of Tafsir have said, they left when the moon was rising, and Mujahid, may Allah have mercy on him, said that the moon was eclipsed that night. And Allah knows best. Musa asked about the grave of Yusuf <span class=\"gray\">(Prophet Joseph)</span>, peace be upon him, and an old woman from among the Children of Israel showed him where it was, so he took the remains with them, and it was said that they were among the things that were carried by Musa himself, may peace be upon them both. It was also said that Yusuf, peace be upon him, had left instructions in his will that if the Children of Israel ever left Egypt, they should take his remains with them.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The following morning, when there was nobody to be found in the Israelite quarters, Fir'awn became angry and his anger intensified since Allah had decreed that he was to be destroyed. So he quickly sent his callers to all his cities, i.e., to mobilize his troops and bring them together, and he called out to them:</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">إِنَّ هَٰؤُلَاءِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, these)</span> meaning, the Children of Israel,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">لَشِرْذِمَةٌ قَلِيلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(indeed are but a small band.)</span> meaning, a small group.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَإِنَّهُمْ لَنَا لَغَائِظُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, they have done what has enraged us.)</span> means, 'every time we have heard anything about them, it has upset us and made us angry.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّا لَجَمِيعٌ حَاذِرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But we are a host all assembled, amply forewarned.)</span> means, 'we are constantly taking precautions lest they betray us.' Some of the Salaf read this with the meaning, \"we are constantly forewarned and forearmed. And I want to destroy them to the last man, and destroy all their lands and property.\" So he and his troops were punished with the very things he sought to inflict upon the Children of Israel. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَخْرَجْنَاهُم مِّن جَنَّاتٍ وَعُيُونٍ - وَكُنُوزٍ وَمَقَامٍ كَرِيمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So, We expelled them from gardens and springs, treasures, and every kind of honorable place.)</span> meaning, they were thrown out of those blessings and into Hell, and they left behind the honorable places, gardens and rivers, wealth, provision, position and power in this world:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَذَٰلِكَ وَأَوْرَثْنَاهَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Thus and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them.)</span> This is like the Ayat:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَوْرَثْنَا الْقَوْمَ الَّذِينَ كَانُوا يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ مَشَارِقَ الْأَرْضِ وَمَغَارِبَهَا الَّتِي بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We made the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We have blessed)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7:137)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَنُرِيدُ أَن نَّمُنَّ عَلَى الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَنَجْعَلَهُمْ أَئِمَّةً وَنَجْعَلَهُمُ الْوَارِثِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We wished to do a favor to those who were weak in the land, and to make them rulers and to make them the inheritors)</span> The two Ayat thereafter: <span class=\"gray\">(28:5-6)</span>.</p>"

    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So, they pursued them at sunrise <span>(60)</span>And when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Musa said: \"We are sure to be overtaken. <span>(61)</span><span class=\"gray\">(Musa)</span> said: \"Nay, verily with me is my Lord.

At that point,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">قَالَ أَصْحَابُ مُوسَىٰ إِنَّا لَمُدْرَكُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(the companions of Musa said: \"We are sure to be overtaken.\")</span> This was because Fir'awn and his people caught up with them on the shores of the Red Sea, so the sea was ahead of them and Fir'awn and his troops were behind them. Hence they said:</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">إِنَّا لَمُدْرَكُونَ - قَالَ كَلَّا ۖ إِنَّ مَعِيَ رَبِّي سَيَهْدِينِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"We are sure to be overtaken.\" <span class=\"gray\">(Musa)</span> said: \"Nay, verily with me is my Lord. He will guide me.\")</span> meaning, 'nothing of what you fear will happen to you, for Allah is the One Who commanded me to bring you here, and He does not go back on His promise.' Harun, peace be upon him, was in the front, with Yusha' bin Nun and a believer from the family of Fir'awn, and Musa, peace be upon him, was in the rear.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">More than one of the scholars of Tafsir said that they stood there not knowing what to do, and Yusha' bin Nun or the believer from the family of Fir'awn said to Musa, peace be upon him, \"O Prophet of Allah, is it here that your Lord commanded you to bring us?\" He said: \"Yes.\" Then Fir'awn and his troops drew near and were very close indeed. At that point Allah commanded his Prophet Musa, peace be upon him, to strike the sea with his staff, so he struck it, and it parted, by the will of Allah. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَانفَلَقَ فَكَانَ كُلُّ فِرْقٍ كَالطَّوْدِ الْعَظِيمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And it parted, and each separate part became like huge mountain.)</span> meaning, like mighty mountains. This was the view of Ibn Mas'ud, Ibn 'Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka'b, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and others. 'Ata' Al-Khurasani said, \"It refers to a pass between two mountains.\" Ibn 'Abbas said, \"The sea divided into twelve paths, one for each of the tribes.\" As-Suddi added, \"And in it there were windows through which they could see one another, and the water was erected like walls.\" Allah sent the wind to the sea bed to make it solid like the land. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَاضْرِبْ لَهُمْ طَرِيقًا فِي الْبَحْرِ يَبَسًا لَّا تَخَافُ دَرَكًا وَلَا تَخْشَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and strike a dry path for them in the sea, fearing neither to be overtaken nor being afraid)</span><span class=\"gray\">(20:77)</span>. And here He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَزْلَفْنَا ثَمَّ الْآخَرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then We brought near the others to that place.)</span> Ibn 'Abbas, 'Ata' Al-Khurasani, Qatadah and As-Suddi said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَزْلَفْنَا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then We brought near)</span> means, \"We brought Fir'awn and his troops near to the sea.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنجَيْنَا مُوسَىٰ وَمَن مَّعَهُ أَجْمَعِينَ - ثُمَّ أَغْرَقْنَا الْآخَرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We saved Musa and all those with him. Then We drowned the others.)</span> meaning: 'We saved Musa and the Children of Israel and whoever followed their religion, and none of them were destroyed, but Fir'awn and his troops were drowned and not one of them remained alive, but was destroyed.' Then Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, in this is indeed a sign,)</span> meaning, this story with its wonders and tales of aid to the believing servants of Allah is definitive proof and evidence of Allah's wisdom.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا كَانَ أَكْثَرُهُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ - وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(yet most of them are not believers. And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.)</span> The explanation of this phrase has already been discussed above.</p>"
