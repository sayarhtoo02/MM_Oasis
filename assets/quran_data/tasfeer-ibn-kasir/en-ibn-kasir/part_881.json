When the hypocrites come to you, they say: \"We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah.\" Allah knows that you are indeed His Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars indeed.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2. They have made their oaths a screen. Thus they hinder <span class=\"gray\">(others)</span> from the path of Allah. Verily, evil is what they used to do.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(3. That is because they believed, and then disbelieved; therefore their hearts are sealed, so they understand not.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4. And when you look at them, their bodies please you; and when they speak, you listen to their words. They are as blocks of wood propped up. They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemies, so beware of them. May Allah curse them! How are they denying the right path?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Case of the Hypocrites and their Behavior</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah the Exalted states that the hypocrites pretended to be Muslims when they went to the Prophet ﷺ. In reality, they were not Muslims, but rather the opposite. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا جَاءَكَ الْمُنَافِقُونَ قَالُوا نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When the hypocrites come to you, they say: \"We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah.\")</span> meaning, 'when the hypocrites come to you, they announce this statement and pretend to believe in it.' Allah informs that there is no substance to their statement, and this is why He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah knows that you are indeed His Messenger,)</span> then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ لَكَاذِبُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars indeed.)</span> meaning, their claims, even though it is true about the Prophet. But they did not believe inwardly in what they declared outwardly, and this is why Allah declared their falsehood about their creed. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اتَّخَذُوا أَيْمَانَهُمْ جُنَّةً فَصَدُّوا عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They have made their oaths a screen. Thus they hinder <span class=\"gray\">(others)</span> from the path of Allah.)</span> meaning, the hypocrites shield themselves from Muslims when they falsely and sinfully swear to be what they are not in reality. Some Muslims were deceived because they did not know their falsehood, and thus, thought that they were Muslims. Some Muslims believed what hypocrites say and even imitated them in their outward behavior. However, inwardly, hypocrites seek the destruction of Islam and its people, and this is why trusting them might bring great harm to many people. This is why Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَصَدُّوا عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّهُمْ سَاءَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Thus they hinder <span class=\"gray\">(others)</span> from the path of Allah. Verily, evil is what they used to do.)</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ آمَنُوا ثُمَّ كَفَرُوا فَطُبِعَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ فَهُمْ لَا يَفْقَهُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That is because they believed, and then disbelieved; therefore their hearts are sealed, so they understand not.)</span> meaning, He has decreed them to be hypocrites because they reverted from faith to disbelief and exchanged guidance for misguidance. Therefore, Allah stamped and sealed their hearts and because of it, they cannot comprehend the guidance, nor any goodness can reach their hearts. Truly, their hearts neither understand, nor attain guidance. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَهُمْ تُعْجِبُكَ أَجْسَامُهُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ يَقُولُوا تَسْمَعْ لِقَوْلِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when you look at them, their bodies please you; and when they speak, you listen to their words.)</span> meaning, hypocrites have a graceful outer appearance and are eloquent. When one hears them speak, he will listen to their eloquent words, even though hypocrites are truly weak and feeble, full of fear, fright and cowardice. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَحْسَبُونَ كُلَّ صَيْحَةٍ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They think that every cry is against them.)</span> means, every time an incident occurs or something frightening happens, they think that it is headed their way. This is indicative of their cowardice, just as Allah said about them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَشِحَّةً عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ فَإِذَا جَاءَ الْخَوْفُ رَأَيْتَهُمْ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ تَدُورُ أَعْيُنُهُمْ كَالَّذِي يُغْشَىٰ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ ۖ فَإِذَا ذَهَبَ الْخَوْفُ سَلَقُوكُمْ بِأَلْسِنَةٍ حِدَادٍ أَشِحَّةً عَلَى الْخَيْرِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ لَمْ يُؤْمِنُوا فَأَحْبَطَ اللَّهُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ ۚ وَكَانَ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Being miserly towards you then when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving like <span class=\"gray\">(those of)</span> one over whom hovers death; but when the fear departs, they will smite you with sharp tongues, miserly towards good. Such have not believed. Therefore Allah makes their deeds fruitless and that is ever easy for Allah.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(33:19)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">They are shapes that do not have much substance, and this is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هُمُ الْعَدُوُّ فَاحْذَرْهُمْ ۚ قَاتَلَهُمُ اللَّهُ ۖ أَنَّىٰ يُؤْفَكُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They are the enemies, so beware of them. May Allah curse them! How are they denying the right path?)</span> means, how they are being led astray to the misguidance, away from the guidance. </p><p lang=\"hmn\" class=\"hmn \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ لِلْمُنَافِقِينَ عَلَامَاتٍ يُعْرَفُونَ بِهَا: تَحِيَّتُهُمْ لَعْنَةٌ وَطَعَامُهُمْ نُهْبَةٌ وَغَنِيمَتُهُمْ غُلُولٌ لَا يَقْرَبُونَ الْمَسَاجِدَ إِلَّا هَجْرًا، وَلَا يَأْتُونَ الصَّلَاةَ إِلَّا دَبْرًا، مُسْتَكْبِرِينَ لَا يَأْلَفُونَ وَلَا يُؤْلَفُونَ، خُشُبٌ بِاللَّيْلِ صُخُبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ - وفِي رِوَايَةٍ - سُخُبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Hypocrites have certain signs that they are known by. Their greeting is really a curse, their food is from stealing and the war booty they collect is from theft. They shun the Masjid and they do not come to the prayer but at its end. They are arrogant; it is neither easy for them to blend in, nor it is easy for people to blend with them. They are like pieces of wood by night and are noisy by day.)</span></p>"
