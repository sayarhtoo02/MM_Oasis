The day that some of the signs of your Lord do come, no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned good with his faith. Say: \"Wait you! We <span class=\"gray\">(too)</span> are waiting. <span>(158)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Disbelievers Await the Commencement of the Hereafter, or Some of its Portents</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah sternly threatens the disbelievers, those who defy His Messengers, deny His Ayat and hinder from His path,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا أَن تَأْتِيَهُمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ أَوْ يَأْتِيَ رَبُّكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do they then wait for anything other than that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span> should come...)</span> on the Day of Resurrection,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">أَوْ يَأْتِيَ بَعْضُ آيَاتِ رَبِّكَ يَوْمَ يَأْتِي بَعْضُ آيَاتِ رَبِّكَ لَا يَنفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(or that some of the signs of your Lord should come! The day that some of the signs of your Lord do come no good will it do to a person to believe then.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Before the commencement of the Day of Resurrection, there will come signs and portents of the Last Hour that will be witnessed by the people living at that time. In a section explaining this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى تَطْلُعَ الشَّمْسُ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا فَإِذَا رَآهَا النَّاسُ آمَنَ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَذَلِكَ حِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Last Hour will not commence until the sun rises from the west. When the people witness that, they will all believe. This is when.</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا يَنفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ آمَنَتْ مِن قَبْلُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before.)</span>) </p><p lang=\"jv\" class=\"jv \">Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثَلَاثٌ إِذَا خَرَجْنَ لَا يَنْفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ آمَنَتْ مِنْ قَبْل أَوْ كَسَبَتْ فِي إِيمَانِهَا خَيْرًا، طُلُوعُ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا وَالدَّجَّالُ وَدَابَّةُ الْأَرْضِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Three, if they appear, then a soul will not benefit from its faith, if it had not believed before or earned good in its faith: when the sun rises from the west, Ad-Dajjal and the Beast of the earth.)</span> Ahmad also recorded this Hadith, and in his narration, the Prophet mentioned the Smoke.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that 'Amr bin Jarir said, \"Three Muslim men sat with Marwan in Al-Madinah and they heard him talking about the signs <span class=\"gray\">(of the Last Hour)</span>. He said that the first sign will be the appearance of Ad-Dajjal. So these men went to 'Abdullah bin 'Amr and told him what they heard from Marwan about the signs. Ibn 'Amr said, Marwan said nothing. I remember that I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ أَوَّلَ الْآياتِ خُرُوجًا طُلُوعُ الشَّمْسِ مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا وَخُرُوجُ الدَّابَّةِ ضُحًى فَأَيَّتُهُمَا كَانَتْ قَبْلَ صَاحِبَتِهَا فَالْأُخْرَى عَلَى أَثَرِهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The first of the signs to appear are the sun rising from the west and the Beast that appears in the early morning. Whichever comes before the other, then the second sign will appear soon after it.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then 'Abdullah said - and he used to read the Scriptures - \"And I think the first of them is the sun rising from the west. That is because when it sets it comes under the Throne, prostrates and seeks permission to return. So it is permitted to return until Allah wants it to rise from the west. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So it does as it normally would, it comes beneath the Throne, it prostrates and seeks permission to return. But it will get no response. Then it will seek permission to return <span class=\"gray\">[again]</span>, but it will get no response, until what Allah wills of the night to pass goes by, and it realizes that if it is permitted to return it would not <span class=\"gray\">[be able to]</span> reach the east. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It says; 'My Lord! The east is so far, what good would I be to the people?' Until the horizons appear as a <span class=\"gray\">[lightless]</span> ring, it seeks permission to return and is told; 'Rise from your place,' so it rises upon the people from where it set.\" Then he recited,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا يَنفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ آمَنَتْ مِن قَبْلُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before,)</span> This was also recorded by Muslim in his Sahih, and Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah in their Sunans. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا يَنفَعُ نَفْسًا إِيمَانُهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ آمَنَتْ مِن قَبْلُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before,)</span> means, when the disbeliever believes then, it will not be accepted from him. As for those who were believers before, if they earned righteous deeds, they will have earned a great deal of good. If they had not done good nor repented before then, it will not be accepted from them, according to the Hadiths that we mentioned. This is also the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">أَوْ كَسَبَتْ فِي إِيمَانِهَا خَيْرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...nor earned good through his faith.)</span> meaning, one's good deeds will not be accepted from him unless he performed good deeds before. Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلِ انتَظِرُوا إِنَّا مُنتَظِرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"Wait you! We <span class=\"gray\">(too)</span> are waiting.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is a stern threat to the disbelievers and a sure promise for those who delay embracing the faith and repenting until a time when faith or repentance shall not avail. This will occur when the sun rises from the west because the Last Hour will then be imminent and its major signs will have begun to appear. Allah said in other Ayat,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَهَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُم بَغْتَةً فَقَدْ جَاءَ أَشْرَاطُهَا فَأَنَّىٰ لَهُمْ إِذَا جَاءَتْهُمْ ذِكْرَاهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do they then await <span class=\"gray\">(anything)</span> other than the Hour, that it should come upon them suddenly? But some of its portents have already come; and when it is upon them, how can they benefit then by their reminder?)</span><span class=\"gray\">[47:18]</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَمَّا رَأَوْا بَأْسَنَا قَالُوا آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ وَكَفَرْنَا بِمَا كُنَّا بِهِ مُشْرِكِينَ - فَلَمْ يَكُ يَنفَعُهُمْ إِيمَانُهُمْ لَمَّا رَأَوْا بَأْسَنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So when they saw Our punishment, they said: \"We believe in Allah alone and reject <span class=\"gray\">(all)</span> that we used to associate with Him as partners.\" Then their faith could not avail them when they saw Our punishment.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[40:84-85]</span></p>"

Their affair is only with Allah, Who then will tell them what they used to do <span>(159)</span></p><div lang=\"it\" class=\"it \"><h2>Criticizing Division in the Religion</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi said that this Ayah was revealed about the Jews and Christians. Al-'Awfi said that Ibn 'Abbas commented,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَرَّقُوا دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُوا شِيَعًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects...)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"Before Muhammad ﷺ was sent, the Jews and Christians disputed and divided into sects. When Muhammad ﷺ was sent, Allah revealed to him,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَرَّقُوا دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُوا شِيَعًا لَّسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects, you have no concern with them in the least.)</span> It is apparent that this Ayah refers to all those who defy the religion of Allah, or revert from it. Allah sent His Messenger ﷺ with guidance and the religion of truth so that He makes it victorious and dominant above all religions. His Law is one and does not contain any contradiction or incongruity. Therefore, those who dispute in the religion,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَكَانُوا شِيَعًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...and break up into sects,)</span> religious sects, just like those who follow the various sects, desires and misguidance - then Allah has purified His Messenger ﷺ from their ways. In a similar Ayah, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">شَرَعَ لَكُم مِّنَ الدِّينِ مَا وَصَّىٰ بِهِ نُوحًا وَالَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span> has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nuh, and that which We have revealed to you.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[42:13]</span> A Hadith reads,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نَحْنُ مَعَاشِرُ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ أَوْلَادُ عَلَّاتٍ دِينُنَا وَاحِدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We, the Prophets, are half brothers but have one religion.)</span> This, indeed, is the straight path which the Messengers have brought and which commands worshipping Allah alone without partners and adhering to the Law of the last Messenger ﷺ whom Allah sent. All other paths are types of misguidance, ignorance, sheer opinion and desires; and as such, the Messengers are free from them. Allah said here,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(You have no concern with them in the least...)</span><span class=\"gray\">[6:159]</span>. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُمْ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْعَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Their affair is only with Allah, Who then will tell them what they used to do.)</span> is similar to His statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَالَّذِينَ هَادُوا وَالصَّابِئِينَ وَالنَّصَارَىٰ وَالْمَجُوسَ وَالَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians, and the Majus, and those who worship others besides Allah; truly, Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[22:17]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah then mentioned His kindness in His decisions and His justice on the Day of Resurrection, when He said,</p>"
