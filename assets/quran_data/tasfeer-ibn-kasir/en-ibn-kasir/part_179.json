    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Do you think that the people of Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim were a wonder among Our signs <span>(9)</span>When the young men fled for refuge to Al-Kahf. They said: \"Our Lord! Bestow on us mercy from Yourself, and facilitate for us our affair in the right way! <span>(10)</span>Therefore, We covered up their hearing in Al-Kahf for a number of years <span>(11)</span>Then We raised them up, that We might test which of the two parties was best at calculating the time period they tarried <span>(12)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Story of the People of Al-Kahf</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Here Allah tells us about the story of the people of Al-Kahf in brief and general terms,then He explains it in more  detail. He Says:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">أَمْ حَسِبْتَ</p><p lang=\"zu\" class=\"zu \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do you think)</span> – O Muhammad –</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنَّ أَصْحَابَ الْكَهْفِ وَالرَّقِيمِ كَانُوا مِنْ آيَاتِنَا عَجَبًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that the people of Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim were a wonder among Our signs?)</span> meaning, their case was not something amazing compared to Our power and ability, for the creation of the heavens and earth, the alternation of night and day and the subjugation of the sun, moon and heavenly bodies, and other mighty signs indicate the great power of Allah and show that He is able to do whatever He wills. He is not incapable of doing more amazing things than the story of the people of the Cave. Similarly, Ibn Jurayj reported Mujahid saying about,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمْ حَسِبْتَ أَنَّ أَصْحَابَ الْكَهْفِ وَالرَّقِيمِ كَانُوا مِنْ آيَاتِنَا عَجَبًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do you think that the people of Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim were a wonder among Our signs?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Among Our signs are things that are more amazing than this. Al-'Awfi reported that Ibn 'Abbas said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمْ حَسِبْتَ أَنَّ أَصْحَابَ الْكَهْفِ وَالرَّقِيمِ كَانُوا مِنْ آيَاتِنَا عَجَبًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do you think that the people of Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim were a wonder among Our signs?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">What I have given to you of knowledge, the Sunnah and the Book is far better than the story of the people of Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim. Muhammad bin Ishaq said: \"<span class=\"gray\">(It means)</span> I have not shown My creatures a proof more amazing than the story of the people of the Al-Kahf and Ar-Raqim.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Kahf refers to a cave in a mountain, which is where the young men sought refuge. With regard to the word Ar-Raqim, Al-'Awfi reported from Ibn 'Abbas that it is a valley near Aylah. This was also said <span class=\"gray\">[in another narration]</span> by 'Atiyah Al-'Awfi and Qatadah. Ad-Dahhak said: \"As for Al-Kahf, it is a cave in the valley, and Ar-Raqim is the name of the valley.\" Mujahid said, \"Ar-Raqim refers to their buildings.\" Others said it refers to the valley in which their cave was.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said about Ar-Raqim: \"Ka'b used to say that it was the town.\" Ibn Jurayj reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Ar-Raqim is the mountain in which the cave was.\" Sa'id bin Jubayr said, \"Ar-Raqim is a tablet of stone on which they wrote the story of the people of the Cave, then they placed it at the entrance to the Cave.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذْ أَوَى الْفِتْيَةُ إِلَى الْكَهْفِ فَقَالُوا رَبَّنَا آتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً وَهَيِّئْ لَنَا مِنْ أَمْرِنَا رَشَدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(Remember)</span> when the young men fled for refuge to Al-Kahf. They said: \"Our Lord! Bestow on us mercy from Yourself, and facilitate for us our affair in the right way!\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Here Allah tells us about those young men who fled from their people for the sake of their religion, fearing persecution. So they fled taking refuge in the cave of a mountain, where they hid from their people. When they entered the cave, they asked Allah to show mercy and kindness towards them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبَّنَا آتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةً </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Our Lord! Bestow on us mercy from Yourself,)</span> meaning, 'give us Your mercy and conceal us from our people.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهَيِّئْ لَنَا مِنْ أَمْرِنَا رَشَدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and facilitate for us our affair in the right way.)</span> means, direct our matter well, i.e., grant us a good end. As was reported in the Hadith:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا قَضَيْتَ لَنَا مِنْ قَضَاءٍ فَاجْعَلْ عَاقِبَتَهُ رَشَدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whatever You have decreed for us, make its consequences good)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَضَرَبْنَا عَلَىٰ آذَانِهِمْ فِي الْكَهْفِ سِنِينَ عَدَدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Therefore, We covered up their hearing in the cave for a number of years.)</span> meaning, 'We caused them to sleep when they entered the cave, and they slept for many years.'</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَاهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then We raised them up)</span> from that slumber, and one of them went out with his Dirhams <span class=\"gray\">(silver coins)</span> to buy them some food, as it will be discussed in more detail below. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَاهُمْ لِنَعْلَمَ أَيُّ الْحِزْبَيْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then We raised them up, that We might test which of the two parties)</span> meaning, the two parties who disputed about them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَحْصَىٰ لِمَا لَبِثُوا أَمَدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(was best at calculating the time period that they tarried.)</span> It was said that this refers to how long they stayed in the cave.</p>"

Ya'juj and Ma'juj are among the progeny of Adam, peace be upon him, as was recorded in the Two Sahihs;</p>\n<p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى يَقُولُ: يَا آدَمُ فَيَقُولُ: لَبَّيْكَ وَسَعْدَيْكَ فَيَقُولُ: ابْعَثْ بَعْثَ النَّارِ، فَيَقُولُ: وَمَا بَعْثُ النَّارِ؟ فَيَقُولُ: مِنْ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ إِلَى النَّارِ وَوَاحِدٌ إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ، فَحِينَئِذٍ يَشِيبُ الصَّغِيرُ وَتَضَعُ كُلُّ ذَاتِ حَمْلٍ حَمْلَهَا. فَقَالَ: إِنَّ فِيكُمْ أُمَّتيْنِ مَا كَانَتَا فِي شَيْءٍ إِلَّا كَثَّرَتَاهُ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ</p>\n<p class=\"en \" lang=\"en\">\"Allah said: \"O Adam.\" Adam said, \"Here I am at Your service.\" Allah said, \"Send forth the group of Hellfire.\" Adam said, \"What is the group of Hellfire?\" Allah said: \"Out of every thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine will go to Hell and one will go to Paradise.\" At that time young men will turn grey and every pregnant female will drop her load.

Verily, Ya'juj and Ma'juj are doing great mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute?\")</span> Ibn Jurayj reported from 'Ata' from Ibn 'Abbas that this meant a great reward, i.e., they wanted to collect money among themselves to give to him so that he would create a barrier between them and Ya'juj and Ma'juj. Dhul-Qarnayn said with kindness, righteousness and good intentions,</p>\n<p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا مَكَّنِّي فِيهِ رَبِّي خَيْرٌ</p>\n<p class=\"en \" lang=\"en\"><span class=\"gray\">(That in which my Lord had established me is better <span class=\"gray\">(than your tribute)</span>.)</span> meaning, the power and authority that Allah has given me is better for me than what you have collected. This is like when Sulayman <span class=\"gray\">(Solomon)</span>, peace be upon him, said:</p>\n<p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَتُمِدُّونَنِ بِمَالٍ فَمَا آتَانِيَ اللَّهُ خَيْرٌ مِّمَّا آتَاكُم</p>\n<p class=\"en \" lang=\"en\"><span class=\"gray\">(Will you help me in wealth?

Give me Zubar of iron,)</span> Zubar is the plural of Zubrah, which means pieces or chunks of something. This was the view of Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah. These pieces were like bricks or blocks, and it was said that each block weighed one Damascene Qintar or more.</p>\n<p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَتَّىٰ إِذَا سَاوَىٰ بَيْنَ الصَّدَفَيْنِ</p>\n<p class=\"en \" lang=\"en\"><span class=\"gray\">(then, when he had filled up the gap between the two mountain-cliffs,)</span> means, he put the blocks on top of one another, starting at the bottom, until he reached the tops of the mountains, filling the width and height of the gap. The scholars differed about the precise width and height.</p>\n<p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">قَالَ انفُخُوا</p>\n<p class=\"en \" lang=\"en\"><span class=\"gray\">(he said: \"Blow;\")</span> means, he lit a fire until the whole thing was burning hot.</p>\n<p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ آتُونِي أُفْرِغْ عَلَيْهِ قِطْرًا</p>\n<p class=\"en \" lang=\"en\"><span class=\"gray\">(he said: \"Bring me Qitran to pour over them.\")</span> Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, 'Ikrimah, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and As-Suddi said it was copper. Some of them added that it was molten. This is similar to the Ayah:</p>\n<p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَسَلْنَا لَهُ عَيْنَ الْقِطْرِ</p>\n<p class=\"en \" lang=\"en\"><span class=\"gray\">(And We caused a fount of Qitran to flow for him)</span><span class=\"gray\">[34:12]</span>.
