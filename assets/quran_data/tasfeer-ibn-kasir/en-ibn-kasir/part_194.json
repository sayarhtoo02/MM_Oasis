This is a challenge against the idolators who claim that they were following guidance in what they were doing. This is similar to the challenge that Allah mentions about the Jews when He says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ هَادُوا إِن زَعَمْتُمْ أَنَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَاءُ لِلَّهِ مِن دُونِ النَّاسِ فَتَمَنَّوُا الْمَوْتَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you Jews!

If you are true, then this supplication will not harm you.' But they refused to do so. An extensive discussion of this has already preceded in Surat Al-Baqarah, and to Allah is the praise. Likewise, Allah mentioned the challenge that was given to the Christians in Surah Āl-'Imrān, when they were persistent in their disbelief and continued in their transgression. They refused to give up their exaggerating claim that 'Isa was the son of Allah. Therefore, Allah mentioned His arguments and proofs against the worship of 'Isa, and that he was merely a creature like Adam. After this, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمَنْ حَاجَّكَ فِيهِ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْا نَدْعُ أَبْنَاءَنَا وَأَبْنَاءَكُمْ وَنِسَاءَنَا وَنِسَاءَكُمْ وَأَنفُسَنَا وَأَنفُسَكُمْ ثُمَّ نَبْتَهِلْ فَنَجْعَل لَّعْنَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْكَاذِبِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then whoever disputes with you about him after <span class=\"gray\">(all this)</span> knowledge that has come to you, say: \"Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves - then we pray and invoke <span class=\"gray\">(sincerely)</span> the curse of Allah upon those who lie.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[3:61]</span> However, they <span class=\"gray\">(the Christians)</span> also retreated from this challenge.</p>"

So I went to him to collect my debt from him. He said to me, 'No, by Allah, I will not pay my debt to you until you disbelieve in Muhammad.' I replied to him, 'No, by Allah, I will not disbelieve in Muhammad until you die and are resurrected again.' He then said to me, 'Verily, if I die and am resurrected, and you come to me, I will also have abundance of wealth and children and I will repay you then.' Then, Allah revealed these Ayat,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَرَأَيْتَ الَّذِي كَفَرَ بِآيَاتِنَا وَقَالَ لَأُوتَيَنَّ مَالًا وَوَلَدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our Ayat and said: \"I shall certainly be given wealth and children.\")</span> until,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَيَأْتِينَا فَرْداً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and he shall come to Us alone.)</span> This was also recorded by the two compilers of the Sahihs and other collections as well. In the wording of Al-Bukhari it states that Khabbab said, \"I used to be a blacksmith in Makkah and I made a sword for Al-'Ās bin Wā'il. So I went to him to collect my pay from him...\" then he mentioned the rest of the Hadith and he said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمِ اتَّخَذَ عِندَ الرَّحْمَٰنِ عَهْدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(or has he taken a covenant from the Most Gracious)</span> \"This means an agreement. \" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَطَّلَعَ الْغَيْبَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Has he known the Unseen)</span> This is a rejection of the person who says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَأُوتَيَنَّ مَالًا وَوَلَدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I shall certainly be given wealth and children.)</span> Meaning, on the Day of Resurrection. In other words, \"Does he know what he will have in the Hereafter, to such an extent that he can swear to it?\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمِ اتَّخَذَ عِندَ الرَّحْمَٰنِ عَهْدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(or has he taken a covenant from the Most Gracious?)</span> Or has he received a promise from Allah that he will be given these things? It has already been stated that in Sahih Al-Bukhari it is mentioned that covenant means an agreement. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">كَلَّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Nay,)</span> This is a participle that opposes what came before it and gives emphasis to what follows it.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَنَكْتُبُ مَا يَقُولُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We shall record what he says,)</span> what he is seeking, and his idea that he has given himself about what he hopes for, and his disbelief in Allah the Most Great.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَنَمُدُّ لَهُ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ مَدًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We shall increase his torment.)</span> This is referring to what will happen in the abode of the Hereafter, because of his saying his disbelief in Allah in this life.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَنَرِثُهُ مَا يَقُولُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We shall inherit from him all that he speaks of,)</span> His wealth and children. It means, \"We will take all of this from him, in opposition to his claim that he will be given more wealth and children in the Hereafter than he had in this life.\" To the contrary, in the Hereafter that which he had in this life will be taken from him. This is why Allah says,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَيَأْتِينَا فَرْدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And he shall come to Us alone.)</span> without wealth or children.</p>"
