    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And they say, \"None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.\" These are their own desires. Say <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad ﷺ)</span>, \"Produce your Burhan if you are truthful. <span>(111)</span>Yes! But whoever submits his face <span class=\"gray\">(himself)</span> to Allah <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. follows Allah's religion of Islamic Monotheism)</span> and he is a Muhsin then his reward is with his Lord <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span>, on such shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve <span>(112)</span>The Jews said that the Christians follow nothing <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. are not on the right religion)</span>; and the Christians said that the Jews follow nothing <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. are not on the right religion)</span>; though they both recite the Scripture. Like unto their word, said those <span class=\"gray\">(the pagans)</span> who know not. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they have been differing <span>(113)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Hopes of the People of the Book</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah made the confusion of the Jews and the Christians clear, since they claim that no one will enter Paradise, unless he is a Jew or a Christian. Similarly, Allah mentioned their claims in Surat Al-Ma'idah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نَحْنُ أَبْنَاءُ اللَّهِ وَأَحِبَّاؤُهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We are the children of Allah and His loved ones)</span><span class=\"gray\">(5:18)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah refuted this false claim and informed them that they will be punished because of their sins. Previously we mentioned their claim that the Fire would not touch them for more than a few days, after which they would be put in Paradise. Allah rebuked this claim, and He said about this baseless claim,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(These are their own desires)</span>. Abu Al-'Aliyah commented, \"These are wishes that they wished Allah would answer, without basis.\" Similar was stated by Qatadah and Ar-Rabi' bin Anas. Allah then said,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">قُلْ </p><p lang=\"fil\" class=\"fil \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say)</span> meaning, \"Say O Muhammad:\"</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Produce your Burhan...\")</span> meaning, \"Your proof\", as Abu Al-'Aliyah, Mujahid, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi' bin Anas stated. Qatadah said that the Ayah means, \"Bring the evidence that supports your statement,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\"> إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(if you are truthful)</span> in your claim. \"</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yes! But whoever submits his face <span class=\"gray\">(himself)</span> to Allah <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. follows Allah's religion of Islamic Monotheism)</span> and he is a Muhsin)</span> meaning, \"Whoever performs deeds in sincerity, for Allah alone without partners.\" In a similar statement, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِنْ حَاجُّوكَ فَقُلْ أَسْلَمْتُ وَجْهِيَ لِلَّهِ وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So if they dispute with you <span class=\"gray\">(Muhammad ﷺ)</span> say: \"I have submitted myself to Allah <span class=\"gray\">(in Islam)</span>, and <span class=\"gray\">(so have)</span> those who follow me.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(3:20)</span></p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Abu Al-'Aliyah and Ar-Rabi' said that,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yes! But whoever submits his face <span class=\"gray\">(himself)</span> to Allah)</span> means, \"Whoever is sincere with Allah.\"</p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">Also, Sa'id bin Jubayr said that,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yes! But whoever submits)</span> means, he is sincere,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجْهَهُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(his face <span class=\"gray\">(himself)</span>)</span> meaning, in his religion.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and he is a Muhsin)</span> following the Messenger ﷺ. For there are two conditions for deeds to be accepted; the deed must be performed for Allah's sake alone and conform to the Shari'ah. When the deed is sincere, but does not conform to the Shari'ah, then it will not be accepted. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلًا لَيْسَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرُنَا فَهُوَ رَدٌّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever performs a deed that does not conform with our matter <span class=\"gray\">(religion)</span>, then it will be rejected.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Hadith was recorded by Muslim. Therefore, the good deeds of the priests and rabbis will not be accepted, even if they are sincerely for Allah alone, because these deeds do not conform with the method of the Messenger ﷺ, who was sent for all mankind. Allah said regarding such cases,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَدِمْنَا إِلَىٰ مَا عَمِلُوا مِنْ عَمَلٍ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ هَبَاءً مَّنثُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We shall turn to whatever deeds they <span class=\"gray\">(disbelievers, polytheists, sinners)</span> did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(25:23)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَعْمَالُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ يَحْسَبُهُ الظَّمْآنُ مَاءً حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءَهُ لَمْ يَجِدْهُ شَيْئًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, until he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(24:39)</span> and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَاشِعَةٌ - عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ - تَصْلَىٰ نَارًا حَامِيَةً - تُسْقَىٰ مِنْ عَيْنٍ آنِيَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Some faces, that Day will be humiliated. Laboring, weary. They will enter in the hot blazing Fire. They will be given to drink from a boiling spring)</span><span class=\"gray\">(88:2-5)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When the deed conforms to the Shari'ah outwardly, but the person did not perform it sincerely for Allah alone, the deed will also be rejected, as in the case of the hypocrites and those who do their deeds to show off. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ يُخَادِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَهُوَ خَادِعُهُمْ وَإِذَا قَامُوا إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ قَامُوا كُسَالَىٰ يُرَاءُونَ النَّاسَ وَلَا يَذْكُرُونَ اللَّهَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives them. And when they stand up for As-Salah <span class=\"gray\">(the prayer)</span>, they stand with laziness to be seen by people, and they do not remember Allah but little.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:142)</span> and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَوَيْلٌ لِّلْمُصَلِّينَ - الَّذِينَ هُمْ عَن صَلَاتِهِمْ سَاهُونَ - الَّذِينَ هُمْ يُرَاءُونَ - وَيَمْنَعُونَ الْمَاعُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So woe unto those performers of Salah <span class=\"gray\">(prayers)</span><span class=\"gray\">(hypocrites)</span>. Those who delay their Salah <span class=\"gray\">(from their stated fixed times)</span>. Those who do good deeds only to be seen <span class=\"gray\">(of men)</span>. And withhold Al-Ma'un <span class=\"gray\">(small kindnesses)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">(107:4-7)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَاءَ رَبِّهِ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا وَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord)</span><span class=\"gray\">(18:110)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He also said in this Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yes, but whoever submits his face <span class=\"gray\">(himself)</span> to Allah <span class=\"gray\">(follows Allah's religion of Islamic Monotheism)</span> and he is a Muhsin)</span>.</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve)</span> guaranteed them the rewards and safety from what they fear and should avoid.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There shall be no fear on them)</span> in the future,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(nor shall they grieve)</span> about what they abandoned in the past. Moreover, Sa'id bin Jubayr said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"<span class=\"gray\">(There shall be no fear on them)</span> in the Hereafter, and</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(nor shall they grieve)</span> about their imminent death.\"</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Jews and Christians dispute among Themselves out of Disbelief and Stubbornness</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالَتِ الْيَهُودُ لَيْسَتِ النَّصَارَىٰ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَقَالَتِ النَّصَارَىٰ لَيْسَتِ الْيَهُودُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَهُمْ يَتْلُونَ الْكِتَابَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Jews said that the Christians follow nothing <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. are not on the right religion)</span>; and the Christians said that the Jews follow nothing <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. are not on the right religion)</span>; though they both recite the Scripture.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah explained the disputes, hatred and stubbornness that the People of the Book have towards each other. Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"When a delegation of Christians from Najran came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, the Jewish rabbis came and began arguing with them before the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Rafi' bin Huraymilah said, 'You do not follow anything,' and he reiterated his disbelief in Jesus and the Injil. Then a Christian man from Najran's delegation said to the Jews, 'Rather, you do not follow anything,' and he reiterated his rejection of Musa's prophethood and his disbelief in the Torah. So Allah revealed the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالَتِ الْيَهُودُ لَيْسَتِ النَّصَارَىٰ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَقَالَتِ النَّصَارَىٰ لَيْسَتِ الْيَهُودُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَهُمْ يَتْلُونَ الْكِتَابَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Jews said that the Christians follow nothing <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. are not on the right religion)</span>; and the Christians said that the Jews follow nothing <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. are not on the right religion)</span>; though they both recite the Scripture.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah made it clear that each party read the affirmation of what they claimed to reject in their Book. Consequently, the Jews disbelieve in Jesus, even though they have the Torah in which Allah took their Covenant by the tongue of Moses to believe in Jesus. Also, the Gospel contains Jesus' assertion that Moses' prophethood and the Torah came from Allah. Yet, each party disbelieved in what the other party had.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ الَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ مِثْلَ قَوْلِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Like unto their word, said those who know not)</span> thus exposing the ignorance displayed by the Jews and the Christians concerning their statements that we mentioned. There is a difference of opinion regarding the meaning of Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(who know not)</span></p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">For instance, Ar-Rabi' bin Anas and Qatadah said that,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ الَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Like unto their word, said those said those who know not)</span> means, \"The Christians said similar statements to the Jews.\" Ibn Jurayj asked 'Ata', \"Who are those 'who know not'?\" 'Ata' said, \"Nations that existed before the Jews and the Christians and before the Torah and the Gospel.\" Also, As-Suddi said that,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ الَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(said those who know not)</span> is in reference to the Arabs who said that Muhammad ﷺ was not following anything <span class=\"gray\">(i. e. did not follow a true or existing religion)</span>. Abu Ja'far bin Jarir chose the view that this Ayah is general and that there is no evidence that specifically supports any of these explanations. So interpreting the Ayah in a general way is better. Allah knows best.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَاللَّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they have been differing.)</span> meaning, that Allah will gather them all on the Day of Return. On that Day, Allah will justly judge between them, for He is never unjust with anyone, even as little as the weight of an atom. This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement in Surat Al-Hajj <span class=\"gray\">(22:17)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَالَّذِينَ هَادُوا وَالصَّابِئِينَ وَالنَّصَارَىٰ وَالْمَجُوسَ وَالَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, those who believe <span class=\"gray\">(in Allah and in His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ)</span>, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians, and the Majus, and those who associate partners with Allah; truly, Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, Allah is over all things a Witness)</span>.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ يَجْمَعُ بَيْنَنَا رَبُّنَا ثُمَّ يَفْتَحُ بَيْنَنَا بِالْحَقِّ وَهُوَ الْفَتَّاحُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"Our Lord will assemble us all together <span class=\"gray\">(on the Day of Resurrection)</span>, then He will judge between us with truth. And He is the Just Judge, the Knower of the true state of affairs.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(34:26)</span>.</p>"
