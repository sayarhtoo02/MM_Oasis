    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Had We sent down this Qur'an on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rent asunder by the fear of Allah. Such are the parables which We put forward to mankind that they may reflect <span>(21)</span>He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful <span>(22)</span>He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, Al-Malik, Al-Quddus, As-Salam, Al-Mu'min, Al-Muhaymin, Al-'Aziz, Al-Jabbar, Al-Mutakabbir. Glory be to Allah! Above all that they associate as partners with Him <span>(23)</span>He is Allah, Al-Khaliq, Al-Bari, Al-Musawwir. To Him belong the Best Names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him. And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise <span>(24)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Asserting the Greatness of the Qur'an</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah the Exalted emphasizes the greatness of the Qur'an, its high status and of being worthy of making hearts humble and rent asunder upon hearing it, because of the true promises and sure threats that it contains,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَوْ أَنْزَلْنَا هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنَ عَلَىٰ جَبَلٍ لَرَأَيْتَهُ خَاشِعًا مُتَصَدِّعًا مِنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Had We sent down this Qur'an on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rent asunder by the fear of Allah.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">If this is the case with a mountain which is hard and huge, that if it was made able to comprehend and understand this Qur'an, will feel humble and crumble from fear of Allah the Exalted, then what about you – O mankind? Why do your hearts not feel softness and humbleness from the fear of Allah, even though you understand Allah's command and comprehend His Book? This is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتِلْكَ الْأَمْثَالُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Such are the parables which We put forward to mankind that they may reflect.)</span> There is a Hadith of the Mutawatir grade that states that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ had someone make him a Minbar. Before that, he used to stand next to a tree trunk in the Masjid to deliver speeches. So, when the Minbar was made and placed in the Masjid, the Prophet ﷺ came to deliver a speech and passed the tree trunk, headed towards the Minbar, the tree trunk started weeping, just like an infant. The tree trunk missed hearing the remembrance of Allah and the revelation that were being recited next to it. In one of the narrations for this Hadith, Al-Hasan Al-Basri said after narrating the Hadith, \"You – mankind – are more worthy to miss the Messenger of Allah ﷺ than the tree trunk!\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Likewise, this honorable Ayah asks that if the solid mountains feel humble and are rent asunder from the fear of Allah, if it heard Allah's Speech and comprehended it, what about you – O mankind – who heard the Qur'an and understood it? Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ أَنَّ قُرْآنًا سُيِّرَتْ بِهِ الْجِبَالُ أَوْ قُطِّعَتْ بِهِ الْأَرْضُ أَوْ كُلِّمَ بِهِ الْمَوْتَىٰ ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if there had been a Qur'an with which mountains could be moved, or the earth could be cloven asunder, or the dead could be made to speak.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(13:31)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">We mentioned the meaning of this Ayah as stating that, if there were a Qur'an that has these qualities, it would be this Qur'an. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّ مِنَ الْحِجَارَةِ لَمَا يَتَفَجَّرُ مِنْهُ الْأَنْهَارُ ۚ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَشَّقَّقُ فَيَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ الْمَاءُ ۚ وَإِنَّ مِنْهَا لَمَا يَهْبِطُ مِنْ خَشْيَةِ اللَّهِ ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And indeed, there are stones out of which rivers gush forth, and indeed, there are of them <span class=\"gray\">(stones)</span> which split asunder so that water flows from them, and indeed, there are of them which fall down for fear of Allah.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:74)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Glorifying Allah the Exalted by mentioning His Names and Attributes</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah the Exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِي لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ۖ عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ ۖ هُوَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ الرَّحِيمُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</span> Allah states that He Alone is worthy of worship, there is no Lord or God for the existence, except Him. All that is being worshipped instead of Allah are false deities. Allah is the All-Knower in the unseen and the seen, He knows all that pertains to the creations that we see, and those we cannot see. Nothing in heaven or on earth ever escapes His knowledge, no matter how great or insignificant, big or small, including ants in darkness. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هُوَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ الرَّحِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</span> was duly explained before at the very beginning of this Tafsir, so it is not necessary to repeat it here, and it asserts that Allah is the Owner of the wide encompassing mercy that entails all of His creation. He is Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim of this life and the Hereafter. Allah the Exalted said in other Ayat,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَرَحْمَتِي وَسِعَتْ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And My mercy embraces all things.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7:156)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَتَبَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ الرَّحْمَةَ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Your Lord has written <span class=\"gray\">(prescribed)</span> mercy for Himself.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:54)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ بِفَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَبِرَحْمَتِهِ فَبِذَٰلِكَ فَلْيَفْرَحُوا هُوَ خَيْرٌ مِمَّا يَجْمَعُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"In the bounty of Allah, and in His mercy; – therein let them rejoice.\" That is better than what <span class=\"gray\">(the wealth)</span> they amass.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(10:58)</span> Allah the Exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِي لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْمَلِكُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, Al-Malik.)</span> Al-Malik, meaning \"The Owner and King of all things,\" Who has full power over them without resistance or hindrance. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْقُدُّوسُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Al-Quddus,)</span> meaning \"The Pure,\" according to Wahb bin Munabbih, while Mujahid and Qatadah said that Al-Quddus means \"The Blessed.\" Ibn Jurayj said that Al-Quddus means \"He Whom the honorable angels glorify.\"</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">السَّلَامُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(As-Salam,)</span> meaning \"Free from any defects or shortcomings that lessen or decrease His perfect attributes and actions.\" Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْمُؤْمِنُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Al-Mu'min,)</span> means \"Who has granted safety to His servants by promising that He will never be unjust to them, \" according to Ad-Dahhak who reported it from Ibn 'Abbas. Qatadah said that Al-Mu'min means that \"Allah affirms that His statements are true,\" while Ibn Zayd said that it means, \"He attested to His faithful servants' having faith in Him.\" Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْمُهَيْمِنُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Al-Muhaymin,)</span> means, according to Ibn 'Abbas and others, \"The Witness for His servants actions,\" that is, the Ever-Watcher over them. Allah said in similar Ayat,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah is Witness over all things.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(58:6)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ اللَّهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَىٰ مَا يَفْعَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and moreover Allah is Witness over what they used to do.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(10:46)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَمَنْ هُوَ قَائِمٌ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ ۗ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Is then He <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span> Who takes charge <span class=\"gray\">(guards)</span> of every person and knows all that he has earned?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(13:33)</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"fi qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fi\">الْعَزِيزُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Al-'Aziz,)</span> meaning that \"He is the Almighty, Dominant over all things.\" Therefore, His majesty is never violated, due to His might, greatness, irresistible power and pride. Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْجَبَّارُ الْمُتَكَبِّرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Al-Jabbar, Al-Mutakabbir)</span>, meaning \"The Only One worthy of being the Compeller and Supreme.\" There is a Hadith in the Sahih Collection in which Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْعَظَمَةُ إِزَارِي، وَالْكِبْرِيَاءُ رِدَائِي، فَمَنْ نَازَعَنِي وَاحِدًا مِنْهُمَا عَذَّبْتُهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Might is My Izar and pride is My Rida; if anyone disputes any one of them with Me, then I will punish him.)</span> Allah the Exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Glory be to Allah! <span class=\"gray\">(High is He)</span> above all that they associate as partners with Him.)</span>, then He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هُوَ اللَّهُ الْخَالِقُ الْبَارِئُ الْمُصَوِّرُ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He is Allah, Al-Khaliq, Al-Bari, Al-Musawwir.)</span> Al-Khaliq refers to measuring and proportioning, Al-Bari refers to inventing and bringing into existence what He has created and measured. Surely, none except Allah is able to measure, bring forth and create whatever He wills to come to existence. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْخَالِقُ الْبَارِئُ الْمُصَوِّرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Al-Khaliq, Al-Bari, Al-Musawwir.)</span> means, if Allah wills something, He merely says to it \"be\" and it comes to existence in the form that He wills and the shape He chooses,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِي أَيِّ صُورَةٍ مَا شَاءَ رَكَّبَكَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In whatever form He willed, He put you together.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(82:8)</span> Allah describing Himself as being Al-Musawwir, Who brings into existence anything He wills in the shape and form He decides.</p><p lang=\"pt\" class=\"pt \">Al-Asma' Al-Husna</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah the Exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَهُ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَىٰ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(To Him belong Al-Asma' Al-Husna <span class=\"gray\">(the Best Names)</span>.)</span> We explained the meaning of this Ayah in the Tafsir of Surat Al-A'raf. The Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ للهِ تَعَالَىٰ تِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ اسْمًا، مِائَةً إِلَّا وَاحِدًا، مَنْ أَحْصَاهَا دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ، وَهُوَ وِتْرٌ يُحِبُّ الْوِتْرَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah the Exalted has ninety-nine Names, one hundred less one; whoever then preserves them, will enter Paradise. Allah is Witr <span class=\"gray\">(One)</span> and He likes the Witr.)</span></p><p lang=\"jv\" class=\"jv \">Everything praises and glorifies Allah</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him.)</span> is similar to His other statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ السَّمَاوَاتُ السَّبْعُ وَالْأَرْضُ وَمَنْ فِيهِنَّ ۚ وَإِنْ مِنْ شَيْءٍ إِلَّا يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِهِ وَلَٰكِنْ لَا تَفْقَهُونَ تَسْبِيحَهُمْ ۗ إِنَّهُ كَانَ حَلِيمًا غَفُورًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft–Forgiving.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:44)</span> Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and He is Al-'Aziz)</span> The Almighty, meaning, His greatness is never humbled,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْحَكِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Al-Hakim)</span> the All-Wise, in His legislation and decrees. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Hashr. All praise is due to Allah.</p>"
