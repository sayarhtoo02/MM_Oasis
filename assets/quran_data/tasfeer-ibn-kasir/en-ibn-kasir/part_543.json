They said, his name was Habib, and he used to work with ropes. He was a sickly man who suffered from leprosy, and he was very charitable, giving half of his earnings in charity, and his Fitrah <span class=\"gray\">(natural inclination)</span> was sound.\" Shabib bin Bishr said, narrating from 'Ikrimah, from Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, that the name of the man mentioned in Ya Sin was Habib An-Najjar, and he was killed by his people.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اتَّبِعُوا الْمُرْسَلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He said: \"O my people!

This interpretation is more apparent, and Allah knows best. Ibn Ishaq said, quoting from what had reached him from Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Ka'b and Wahb, 'When he said that, they turned on him as one, and killed him at once, and he had no one to protect him from that.'\" Qatadah said, \"They started to stone him while he was saying, 'O Allah, guide my people for they do not know, and they kept stoning him until he died a violent death, and he was still praying for them.' May Allah have mercy on him.\"</p>"
