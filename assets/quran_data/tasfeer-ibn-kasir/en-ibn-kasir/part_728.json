Believe in Allah, and His Messenger, and the Book <span class=\"gray\">(the Qur'an)</span> which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before; and whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away <span>(136)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Order to Have Faith after Believing</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah commands His faithful servants to adhere to all the elements of faith, its branches, pillars and cornerstones. This is not stated as mere redundancy, but from the view of completing faith and the continual maintenence of it. For instance, the believer proclaims in every prayer,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Guide us to the straight way.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[1:6]</span> which means, make us aware of the straight path and increase us in guidance and strengthen us on it.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In this Ayah <span class=\"gray\">[4:136]</span>, Allah commands the believers to believe in Him and in His Messenger, just as He said elsewhere,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَآمِنُوا بِرَسُولِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe!

Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِاللَّهِ وَمَلَائِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا بَعِيدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away.)</span> meaning, he will have deviated from the correct guidance and strayed far away from its path.</p>"

    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Verily, those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe <span class=\"gray\">(again)</span>, and <span class=\"gray\">(again)</span> disbelieve, and go on increasing in disbelief; Allah will not forgive them, nor guide them on the <span class=\"gray\">(right)</span> way <span>(137)</span>Give to the hypocrites the tidings that there is for them a painful torment <span>(138)</span>Those who take disbelievers for friends instead of believers, do they seek honor with them? Verily, then to Allah belongs all honor <span>(139)</span>And it has already been revealed to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in talk other than that; certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell <span>(140)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Characteristics of the Hypocrites and Their Destination</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah states that whoever embraces the faith, reverts from it, embraces it again, reverts from it and remains on disbelief and increases in it until death, then he will never have a chance to gain accepted repentance after death. Nor will Allah forgive him, or deliver him from his plight to the path of correct guidance. This is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> لَّمْ يَكُنِ اللَّهُ لِيَغْفِرَ لَهُمْ وَلَا لِيَهْدِيَهُمْ سَبِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah will not forgive them, nor guide them on the <span class=\"gray\">(right)</span> way)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that his father said that Ahmad bin 'Abdah related that Hafs bin Jami' said that Samak said that 'Ikrimah reported that Ibn 'Abbas commented;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ ازْدَادُوا كُفْرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and go on increasing in disbelief)</span>, \"They remain on disbelief until they die.\" Mujahid said similarly. Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَشِّرِ الْمُنَافِقِينَ بِأَنَّ لَهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Give to the hypocrites the tidings that there is for them a painful torment.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Hence, the hypocrites have this characteristic, for they believe, then disbelieve, and this is why their hearts become sealed. Allah describes the hypocrites as taking the disbelievers as friends instead of the believers, meaning they are the disbelievers' supporters in reality, for they give them their loyalty and friendship in secret. They also say to disbelievers when they are alone with them, \"We are with you, we only mock the believers by pretending to follow their religion.\" Allah said, while chastising them for being friends with the disbelievers,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَيَبْتَغُونَ عِندَهُمُ الْعِزَّةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(do they seek honor, with them)</span> Allah then states that honor, power and glory is for Him Alone without partners, and for those whom Allah grants such qualities to. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ الْعِزَّةَ فَلِلَّهِ الْعِزَّةُ جَمِيعًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whosoever desires honor, then to Allah belong all honor)</span><span class=\"gray\">[35:10]</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلِلَّهِ الْعِزَّةُ وَلِرَسُولِهِ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلَٰكِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But honor belongs to Allah, and to His Messenger, and to the believers, but the hypocrites know not)</span><span class=\"gray\">[63:8]</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The statement that honor is Allah's Alone, is meant to encourage the servants to adhere to their servitude to Allah and to be among His faithful servants who will gain victory in this life and when the Witnesses stand up to testify on the Day of Resurection. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَدْ نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الْكِتَابِ أَنْ إِذَا سَمِعْتُمْ آيَاتِ اللَّهِ يُكْفَرُ بِهَا وَيُسْتَهْزَأُ بِهَا فَلَا تَقْعُدُوا مَعَهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يَخُوضُوا فِي حَدِيثٍ غَيْرِهِ إِنَّكُمْ إِذًا مِّثْلُهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And it has already been revealed to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in talk other than that; certainly in that case you would be like them.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Ayah means, if you still commit this prohibition after being aware of its prohibition, sitting with them where Allah's Ayat are rejected, mocked at and denied, and you sanction such conduct, then you have participated with them in what they are doing. So Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّكُمْ إِذًا مِّثْلُهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(But if you stayed with them)</span> certainly in that case you would be like them.)</span> concerning the burden they will earn. What has already been revealed in the Book – as the Ayah says – is the Ayah in Surat Al-An'am <span class=\"gray\">[6]</span>, which was revealed in Makkah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ الَّذِينَ يَخُوضُونَ فِي آيَاتِنَا فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when you see those who engage in false conversation about Our verses <span class=\"gray\">(of the Qur'an)</span> by mocking at them, stay away from them)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Muqatil bin Hayyan said that this Ayah <span class=\"gray\">[4:140]</span> abrogated the Ayah in Surat Al-An'am, referring to the part that says here,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّكُمْ إِذًا مِّثْلُهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(But if you stayed with them)</span> certainly in that case you would be like them)</span>, and Allah's statement in Al-An'am,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا عَلَى الَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ مِنْ حِسَابِهِم مِّن شَيْءٍ وَلَٰكِن ذِكْرَىٰ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who fear Allah, keep their duty to Him and avoid evil, are not responsible for them <span class=\"gray\">(the disbelievers)</span> in any case, but <span class=\"gray\">(their duty)</span> is to remind them, that they may have Taqwa)</span><span class=\"gray\">[6:69]</span>. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ جَامِعُ الْمُنَافِقِينَ وَالْكَافِرِينَ فِي جَهَنَّمَ جَمِيعًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely, Allah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell.)</span> means, just as the hypocrites participate in the Kufr of disbelievers, Allah will join them all together to reside in the Fire for eternity, dwelling in torment, punishment, enchained, restrained and in drinking boiling water.</p>"
