    "text": "<p class=\"en translation\" lang=\"en\">Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose. Then of them are some who wrong themselves, and of them are some who follow a middle course, and of them are some who are, by Allah's leave, foremost in good deeds. That – that is indeed a great grace <span>(32)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Inheritance of the Qur'an is of three kinds</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah says: 'Then We made those who uphold the Book confirming what came before, the one whom We have chosen from among Our servants. They are this Ummah, who are divided into three types.' Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمِنْهُمْ ظَالِمٌ لِنَفْسِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then of them are some who wrong themselves,)</span> these are the ones who are careless about doing some obligatory actions, and who commit some forbidden actions.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَمِنْهُمْ مُقْتَصِدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and of them are some who follow a middle course,)</span> these are the ones who fulfill their obligations and avoid things that are forbidden, but they may neglect some good deeds and do some things which are disliked.</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِالْخَيْرَاتِ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and of them are some who are, by Allah's leave, foremost in good deeds.)</span> these are the ones who do obligatory actions and things which are encouraged, and who avoid doing unlawful and disliked actions, and avoid some actions which are permissible. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas commented on the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا الْكِتَابَ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose.)</span> \"This refers to the Ummah of Muhammad ﷺ. Allah caused it to inherit every Book that He had revealed; those who wrong themselves will be forgiven, those who follow a middle course will have an easy accounting, and those who are foremost in good deeds will enter Paradise without being brought to account.\" Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani reported from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said one day:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">شَفَاعَتِي لِأَهْلِ الْكَبَائِرِ مِنْ أُمَّتِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(My intercession will be for those among my Ummah who commit major sins.)</span>\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Those who are foremost in good deeds will enter Paradise without being brought to account; those who follow a middle course will enter Paradise by the mercy of Allah; and those who wrong themselves and Ashab Al-A'raf will enter Paradise by the intercession of Muhammad ﷺ.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was also reported from a number of the Salaf that those among this Ummah who wrong themselves are still among those whom Allah has chosen, even though they are imperfect and fell short <span class=\"gray\">[by not adhering to the straight path]</span>. Others said that those who wrong themselves are not part of this Ummah and are not among those whom Allah has chosen and who inherited the Book. The correct view is that they are also part of this Ummah.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Virtues of the Scholars</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The scholars are the most fortunate of people with regard to this blessing, and the most entitled to this mercy. Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Qays bin Kathir said, \"One of the people of Al-Madinah came to Abu Ad-Darda', may Allah be pleased with him, when he was in Damascus. <span class=\"gray\">[Abu Ad-Darda']</span> said, 'What brought you here, my brother?' He said, 'A Hadith which I heard that you narrate from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.' He said, 'Have you come for trade?' He said, 'No.' He said, 'Have you come for any other reason?' He said, 'No.' He said, 'Have you come only to seek this Hadith?' He said, 'Yes.' He, may Allah be pleased with him said, 'I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ سَلَكَ طَرِيقًا يَطْلُبُ فِيهَا عِلْمًا، سَلَكَ اللهُ تَعَالَى بِهِ طَرِيقًا إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ لَتَضَعُ أَجْنِحَتَهَا رِضًا لِطَالِبِ الْعِلْمِ، وَإِنَّهُ لَيَسْتَغْفِرُ لِلْعَالِمِ مَنْ فِي السَّمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ حَتَّى الْحِيتَانُ فِي الْمَاءِ، وَفَضْلُ الْعَالِمِ عَلَى الْعَابِدِ كَفَضْلِ الْقَمَرِ عَلَى سَائِرِ الْكَوَاكِبِ، وَإِنَّ الْعُلَمَاءَ هُمْ وَرَثَةُ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ، وَإِنَّ الْأَنْبِيَاءَ لَمْ يُوَرِّثُوا دِينَارًا وَلَا دِرْهَمًا، وَإِنَّمَا وَرَّثُوا الْعِلْمَ، فَمَنْ أَخَذَ بِهِ أَخَذَ بِحَظٍّ وَافِرٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever follows a path to seek knowledge, Allah will show him the way to Paradise. The angels lower their wings being pleased with the one who seeks knowledge. Whoever is in the heavens and on earth, even the fish in the sea, ask for forgiveness for the scholar. The superiority of the scholar over the worshipper is like that of the moon over all other heavenly bodies. The scholars are the heirs of the Prophets, for the Prophets did not leave behind Dinars and Dirhams, but they left behind knowledge; and whoever receives it, receives an abundance of good fortune.)</span>'\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was also reported by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah.</p>"

It was recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ لَبِسَ الْحَرِيرَ فِي الدُّنْيَا لَمْ يَلْبَسْهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever wears silk in this world, will not wear it in the Hereafter.)</span> And he ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هِيَ لَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا، وَلَكُمْ فِي الْاخِرَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is for them in this world, and for you in the Hereafter.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي أَذْهَبَ عَنَّا الْحَزَنَ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they will say: \"All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who has removed from us <span class=\"gray\">(all)</span> grief...\")</span> which means fear of everything that is feared; it has been lifted from us and we have been relieved of all that we used to fear of the anxieties of the world and the Hereafter.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and others said, \"He forgives them for their major sins, and appreciates even the smallest of their good deeds.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِي أَحَلَّنَا دَارَ الْمُقَامَةِ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who, out of His grace, has lodged us in a home that will last forever,)</span> means, 'Who has given us this position and status out of His grace and blessing and mercy, for our good deeds are not equivalent to this.' It was reported in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَنْ يُدْخِلَ أَحَدًا مِنْكُمْ عَمَلُهُ الْجَنَّةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(None of you will enter Paradise by virtue of his good deeds.)</span> They said, \"Not even you, O Messenger of Allah?\" He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا أَنَا إِلَّا أَنْ يَتَغَمَّدَنِي اللهُ تَعَالَى بِرَحْمَةٍ مِنْهُ وَفَضْلٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Not even me, unless Allah encompasses me with His mercy and grace.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا نَصَبٌ وَلَا يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا لُغُوبٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(where toil will touch us not nor weariness will touch us.)</span> means, neither hardship nor exhaustion will touch us. The words translated here as \"toil\" and \"weariness\" both mean exhaustion, as if what is meant by the negation of both is that neither their bodies nor their souls will become exhausted; and Allah knows best. They used to exhaust themselves in worshipping this world, but their obligations will come to an end when they enter Paradise, where they will enjoy eternal rest and repose. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا هَنِيئًا بِمَا أَسْلَفْتُمْ فِي الْأَيَّامِ الْخَالِيَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Eat and drink at ease for that which you have sent on before you in days past!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(69:24)</span></p>"
