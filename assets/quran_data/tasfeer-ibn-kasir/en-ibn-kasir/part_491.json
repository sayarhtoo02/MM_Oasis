    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"O my son! If it be <span class=\"gray\">(anything)</span> equal to the weight of a grain of mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens or on the earth, Allah will bring it forth. Verily, Allah is Subtle, Well-Aware. <span>(16)</span>\"O my son! Perform the Salah, enjoin the good, and forbid the evil, and bear with patience whatever befalls you. Verily, these are some of the important commandments. <span>(17)</span>\"And turn not your face away from men with pride, nor walk in insolence through the earth. Verily, Allah likes not any arrogant boaster. <span>(18)</span>\"And be moderate in your walking, and lower your voice. Verily, the harshest of all voices is the braying of the asses. <span>(19)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is useful advice which Allah tells us Luqman gave, so that people may follow it and take it as a good example.He said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا بُنَيَّ إِنَّهَا إِنْ تَكُ مِثْقَالَ حَبَّةٍ مِنْ خَرْدَلٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O my son! If it be <span class=\"gray\">(anything)</span> equal to the weight of a grain of mustard seed,)</span> means, if a wrong action or a sin be equal to the size of a grain of mustard seed.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">يَأْتِ بِهَا اللَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah will bring it forth.)</span> means, He will bring it forth on the Day of Resurrection, when it is placed in the Scales of justice and everyone is rewarded or punished for his actions – if they are good, he will be rewarded and if they are bad he will be punished. This is like the Ayat:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَنَضَعُ الْمَوَازِينَ الْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ فَلَا تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئًا ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We shall set up Balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything)</span><span class=\"gray\">(21:47)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمَنْ يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُ - وَمَنْ يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَهُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So, whosoever does good equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(99:7-8)</span> Even if this tiny thing were to be hidden inside a solid rock or anywhere in the heavens and the earth, Allah will bring it forth, because nothing is hidden from Him, not even the weight of a speck of dust in the heavens or on the earth. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَطِيفٌ خَبِيرٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah is Subtle, Well-Aware.)</span> meaning, His knowledge is subtle, for nothing is hidden from Him, no matter how small, subtle and minute.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خَبِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Well-Aware.)</span> even of the footsteps of an ant in the darkest night. Then he <span class=\"gray\">(Luqman)</span> said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا بُنَيَّ أَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O my son! Perform the Salah,)</span> meaning, offer the prayer properly at the appointed times.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأْمُرْ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَانْهَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(enjoin the good, and forbid the evil,)</span> meaning, to the best of your ability and strength.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاصْبِرْ عَلَىٰ مَا أَصَابَكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and bear with patience whatever befalls you.)</span> Luqman knew that whoever enjoins what is good and forbids what is evil, will inevitably encounter harm and annoyance from people, so he told him to be patient.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ الْأُمُورِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, these are some of the important commandments.)</span> means, being patient when people cause harm or annoyance is one of the most important commandments.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تُصَعِّرْ خَدَّكَ لِلنَّاسِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And turn not your face away from men with pride)</span> means, 'do not turn your face away from people when you speak to them or they speak to you, looking down on them in an arrogant fashion. Rather be gentle towards them and greet them with a cheerful face,' as it says in the Hadith:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ أَنْ تَلْقَى أَخَاكَ وَوَجْهُكَ إِلَيْهِ مُنْبَسِطٌ، وَإِيَّاكَ وَإِسْبَالَ الْإِزَارِ فَإِنَّهَا مِنَ الْمَخِيلَةِ، وَالْمَخِيلَةُ لَا يُحِبُّهَا اللهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...even if it is only by greeting your brother with a cheerful countenance. And beware of letting your lower garment trail below your ankles, for this is a kind of boasting, and Allah does not like boasting.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَمْشِ فِي الْأَرْضِ مَرَحًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(nor walk in insolence through the earth.)</span> means, 'do not be boastful, arrogant, proud and stubborn. Do not do that, for Allah will hate you.' So he said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ كُلَّ مُخْتَالٍ فَخُورٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah likes not any arrogant boaster.)</span> meaning, one who shows off and admires himself, feeling that he is better than others. And Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَمْشِ فِي الْأَرْضِ مَرَحًا ۖ إِنَّكَ لَنْ تَخْرِقَ الْأَرْضَ وَلَنْ تَبْلُغَ الْجِبَالَ طُولًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth nor can you attain a stature like the mountains in height.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:37)</span>. We have already discussed this is detail in the appropriate place.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Command to be Moderate in Walking</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاقْصِدْ فِي مَشْيِكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And be moderate in your walking,)</span> means, walk in a moderate manner, neither slow and lazy nor excessively fast, but be moderate, somewhere in between these two extremes.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاغْضُضْ مِنْ صَوْتِكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and lower your voice.)</span> means, do not exaggerate in your speaking and do not raise your voice unnecessarily. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ أَنْكَرَ الْأَصْوَاتِ لَصَوْتُ الْحَمِيرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the harshest of all voices is the braying of the asses.)</span> Mujahid and others said, \"The most ugly of voices is the voice of the donkey, i.e., when a person raises his voice, the resulting noise is like the voice of a donkey in its loudness. Moreover this is hateful to Allah. Likening a loud voice to that of a donkey implies that it is forbidden and extremely blameworthy, because the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيْسَ لَنَا مَثَلُ السُّوءِ، الْعَائِدُ فِي هِبَتِهِ كَالْكَلْبِ يَقِيءُ ثُمَّ يَعُودُ فِي قَيْئِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is not befitting us to be an evil parable. The person who takes back his gift, he is like a dog that vomits and then goes back to his vomit.)</span></p><p lang=\"zh\" class=\"zh \">The Advice of Luqman</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is very useful advice, which the Qur'an tells us about Luqman. Many other proverbs and words of advice were also narrated from him, some examples of which we will quote below, as basic principles:</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn 'Umar said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ لُقْمَانَ الْحَكِيمَ كَانَ يَقُولُ: إِنَّ اللهَ إِذَا اسْتَوْدَعَ شَيْئًا حَفِظَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Luqman the Wise used to say: when something is entrusted to the care of Allah, He protects it.)</span> It was narrated that As-Sari bin Yahya said: \"Luqman said to his son: 'Wisdom puts the poor in the company of kings.'\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was also narrated that 'Awn bin 'Abdullah said: \"Luqman said to his son: 'O my son! When you come to a gathering of people, greet them with Salam, then sit at the edge of the group, and do not speak until you see that they have finished speaking. Then if they remember Allah, join them, but if they speak of anything else, then leave them and go to another group'.\"</p>"

    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">See you not that Allah has subjected for you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth, and has completed and perfected His graces upon you, apparent and hidden? Yet of mankind is he who disputes about Allah without knowledge or guidance or a Book giving light <span>(20)</span>And when it is said to them: \"Follow that which Allah has sent down,\" they say: \"Nay, we shall follow that which we found our fathers <span class=\"gray\">(following)</span>.\" Even if Shaytan invites them to the torment of the Fire <span>(21)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Reminder of Blessings</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Here Allah reminds His creation of the blessings He bestows upon them in this world and the Hereafter. In the heavens He has subjugated for them the stars which give them light during the night and during the day, and He has created clouds, rain, snow and hail, and made the heavens a canopy which covers and protects them. On earth He has created for them stability and rivers, trees, crops and fruits; He has completed and perfected His graces upon them, apparent and hidden, by sending Messengers, revealing Books and removing doubts and excuses. Yet despite all this, not all the people believe, and indeed there are those who dispute concerning Allah, that is, His Tawhid, and His sending the Messengers. Their dispute is without knowledge and they have no sound evidence or valid inherited Book. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يُجَادِلُ فِي اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَلَا هُدًى وَلَا كِتَابٍ مُنِيرٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And among men is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge or guidance, or a Book giving light <span class=\"gray\">(from Allah)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(22:8)</span> meaning clear and unambiguous.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when it is said to them)</span> means, to these people who dispute about the Oneness of Allah.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اتَّبِعُوا مَا أَنْزَلَ اللَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Follow that which Allah has sent down,\")</span> means, the pure Divine Laws that He has sent down to His Messengers,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالُوا بَلْ نَتَّبِعُ مَا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ آبَاءَنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(they say: \"Nay, we shall follow that which we found our fathers <span class=\"gray\">(following)</span>.\")</span> means, they have no other proof except the fact that they are following their forefathers. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوَلَوْ كَانَ آبَاؤُهُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَهْتَدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Even though their fathers did not understand anything nor were they guided)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:170)</span> meaning, 'what do you think, you who take the forefathers' deeds as proof, that they were misguided and you are following in their footsteps?' Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوَلَوْ كَانَ الشَّيْطَانُ يَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَىٰ عَذَابِ السَّعِيرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Even if Shaytan invites them to the torment of the Fire?)</span></p>"
