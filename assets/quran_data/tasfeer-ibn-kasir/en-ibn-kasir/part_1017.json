Allah also said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّىٰ نَبْعَثَ رَسُولًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger <span class=\"gray\">(to give warning)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[17:15]</span> This is why Allah said here,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا تَأْوِيلَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Await they just for the final fulfillment of the event)</span> in reference to what they were promised of torment, punishment, the Fire; or Paradise, according to Mujahid and several others.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">يَوْمَ يَأْتِي تَأْوِيلُهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day the event is finally fulfilled,)</span> on the Day of Resurrection, according to Ibn 'Abbas,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَقُولُ الَّذِينَ نَسُوهُ مِن قَبْلُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(those who neglected it before will say)</span> those who ignored it in this life and neglected abiding by its implications will say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَدْ جَاءَتْ رُسُلُ رَبِّنَا بِالْحَقِّ فَهَل لَّنَا مِن شُفَعَاءَ فَيَشْفَعُوا لَنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Verily, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth, now are there any intercessors for us that they might intercede on our behalf?\")</span> so that we are saved from what we ended up in.</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">أَوْ نُرَدُّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Or could we be sent back\")</span>, to the first life,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَنَعْمَلَ غَيْرَ الَّذِي كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"So that we might do <span class=\"gray\">(good)</span> deeds other than those <span class=\"gray\">(evil)</span> deeds which we used to do?\")</span>.

    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Indeed, your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over <span class=\"gray\">(Istawa)</span> the Throne. He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly, and <span class=\"gray\">(He created)</span> the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His command. Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of all that exists <span>(54)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Universe was created in Six Days</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah states that He created the universe, the heavens and earth and all that is in, on and between them in six days, as He has stated in several Ayat in the Qur'an. These six days are: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. On Friday, the entire creation was assembled and on that day, Adam was created. There is a difference of opinion whether these days were the same as our standard days as suddenly comes to the mind, or each day constitutes one thousand years, as reported from Mujahid, Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, and from Ibn 'Abbas according to Ad-Dahhak's narration from him. As for Saturday, no creation took place in it since it is the seventh day of <span class=\"gray\">(of the week)</span>. The word 'As-Sabt' means stoppage, or break. </p><p lang=\"fil\" class=\"fil \">Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Hurayrah saying: 'Allah's Messenger ﷺ told me:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خَلَقَ اللهُ، (عَزَّ وَجَلَّ)، التُّرْبَةَ يَوْمَ السَّبْتِ، وَخَلَقَ فِيهَا الْجِبَالَ يَوْمَ الْأَحَدِ، وَخَلَقَ الشَّجَرَ يَوْمَ الْاثْنَيْنِ، وَخَلَقَ الْمَكْرُوهَ يَوْمَ الثُّلَاثَاءِ، وَخَلَقَ النُّورَ يَوْمَ الْأَرْبِعَاءِ، وَبَثَّ فِيهَا الدَّوَابَّ يَوْمَ الْخَمِيسِ، وَخَلَقَ آدَمَ، عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ، بَعْدَ الْعَصْرِ مِنْ يَوْم الْجُمُعَةِ، فِي آخِرِ الْخَلْقِ، فِي آخِرِ سَاعَةٍ مِنْ سَاعَاتِ الْجُمُعَةِ، فِيمَا بَيْنَ الْعَصْرِ إِلَى اللَّيْلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah created the dust on Saturday, and He created the mountains on Sunday, and He created the trees on Monday, and He created the unpleasant things on Tuesday and He created the light on Wednesday and He spread the creatures through out it on Thursday and He created Adam after 'Asr on Friday. He was the last created during the last hour of Friday, between 'Asr and the night.)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Meaning of Istawa</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">As for Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and then He rose over <span class=\"gray\">(Istawa)</span> the Throne)</span> the people had several conflicting opinions over its meaning. However, we follow the way that our righteous predecessors took in this regard, such as Malik, Al-Awza'i, Ath-Thawri, Al-Layth bin Sa'd, Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad, Ishaq bin Rahwayh and the rest of the scholars of Islam, in past and present times. Surely, we accept the apparent meaning of, Al-Istawa, without discussing its true essence, equating it <span class=\"gray\">(with the attributes of the creation)</span>, or altering or denying it <span class=\"gray\">(in any way or form)</span>. We also believe that the meaning that comes to those who equate Allah with the creation is to be rejected, for nothing is similar to Allah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[42:11]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Indeed, we assert and affirm what the Imams said, such as Nu'aym bin Hammad Al-Khuza'i, the teacher of Imam Al-Bukhari, who said, \"Whoever likens Allah with His creation, will have committed Kufr. Whoever denies what Allah has described Himself with, will have committed Kufr. Certainly, there is no resemblance <span class=\"gray\">(of Allah with the creation)</span> in what Allah and His Messenger ﷺ have described Him with. Whoever attests to Allah's attributes that the plain Ayat and authentic Hadiths have mentioned, in the manner that suits Allah's majesty, all the while rejecting all shortcomings from Him, will have taken the path of guidance.\"</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Day and the Night are among the Signs of Allah</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُغْشِي اللَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly,)</span> meaning, the darkness goes away with the light, and the light goes away with the darkness. Each of them seeks the other rapidly, and does not come late, for when this vanishes, the other comes, and vice versa. Allah also said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَآيَةٌ لَّهُمُ اللَّيْلُ نَسْلَخُ مِنْهُ النَّهَارَ فَإِذَا هُم مُّظْلِمُونَ - وَالشَّمْسُ تَجْرِي لِمُسْتَقَرٍّ لَّهَا ذَٰلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ - وَالْقَمَرَ قَدَّرْنَاهُ مَنَازِلَ حَتَّىٰ عَادَ كَالْعُرْجُونِ الْقَدِيمِ - لَا الشَّمْسُ يَنبَغِي لَهَا أَن تُدْرِكَ الْقَمَرَ وَلَا اللَّيْلُ سَابِقُ النَّهَارِ وَكُلٌّ فِي فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And a sign for them is the night. We withdraw therefrom the day, and behold, they are in darkness. And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term <span class=\"gray\">(appointed)</span>. That is the decree of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing. And the moon, We have measured for it mansions <span class=\"gray\">(to traverse)</span> till it returns like the old dried curved date stalk. It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day. They all float, each in an orbit.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[36:37-40]</span> Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا اللَّيْلُ سَابِقُ النَّهَارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Nor does the night outstrip the day)</span><span class=\"gray\">[36:40]</span> means, the night follows the day in succession and does not come later or earlier than it should be. This is why Allah said here,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَاتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(seeking it rapidly, and <span class=\"gray\">(He created)</span> the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His command.)</span> meaning, all are under His command, will and dominion. Allah alerted us afterwards,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely, His is the creation and commandment)</span> the dominion and the decision. Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the all that exists!)</span> which is similar to the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">تَبَارَكَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ فِي السَّمَاءِ بُرُوجًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Blessed be He Who has placed in the heaven big stars)</span><span class=\"gray\">[25:61]</span> Abu Ad-Darda' said a supplication, that was also attributed to the Prophet ﷺ,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْمُلْكُ كُلُّـهُ وَلَكَ الْحَمْدُ كُلُّهُ وَإِلَيْكَ يُرْجَعُ الْأَمْرُ كُلُّهُ، أَسْأَلُكَ مِنَ الْخَيْرِ كُلِّهِ وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الشَّرِّ كُلِّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Allah! Yours is all the kingdom, all the praise, and Yours is the ownership of all affairs. I ask You for all types of good and seek refuge with You from all types of evil.)</span></p>"
