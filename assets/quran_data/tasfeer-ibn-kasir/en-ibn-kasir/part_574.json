Then Allah tells us that Paradise will never come to an end or disappear or cease to be. He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَرِزْقُنَا مَا لَهُ مِنْ نَفَادٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, this is Our provision which will never finish.)</span> This is like the Ayat:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا عِنْدَكُمْ يَنْفَدُ ۖ وَمَا عِنْدَ اللَّهِ بَاقٍ ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whatever is with you, will be exhausted, and whatever is with Allah will remain)</span><span class=\"gray\">(16:96)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَطَاءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(a gift without an end.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11:108)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(for them is a reward that will never come to an end.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(84:25)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُكُلُهَا دَائِمٌ وَظِلُّهَا ۚ تِلْكَ عُقْبَى الَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْا ۖ وَعُقْبَى الْكَافِرِينَ النَّارُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(its provision is eternal and so is its shade; this is the end of those who have Taqwa, and the end <span class=\"gray\">(final destination)</span> of the disbelievers is Fire.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(13:35)</span>. And there are many similar Ayat.</p>"
