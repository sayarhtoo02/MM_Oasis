    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So nothing was the answer of people except that they said: \"Kill him or burn him.\" Then Allah saved him from the fire. Verily, in this are indeed signs for a people who believe <span>(24)</span>And <span class=\"gray\">(Ibrahim)</span> said: \"You have taken idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall deny each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper. <span>(25)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Response of Ibrahim's People – and how Allah controlled the Fire</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah tells us how Ibrahim's people stubbornly and arrogantly disbelieved, and how they resisted the truth with falsehood. After Ibrahim addressed them with his words of clear guidance,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِلَّا أَنْ قَالُوا اقْتُلُوهُ أَوْ حَرِّقُوهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(except that they said: \"Kill him or burn him.\")</span> This was because proof had clearly been established against them, so they resorted to using their power and strength.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالُوا ابْنُوا لَهُ بُنْيَانًا فَأَلْقُوهُ فِي الْجَحِيمِ - فَأَرَادُوا بِهِ كَيْدًا فَجَعَلْنَاهُمُ الْأَسْفَلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They said: \"Build for him a building and throw him into the blazing fire!\" So they plotted a plot against him, but We made them the lowest.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(37:97-98)</span>. They spent a long time gathering a huge amount of firewood, they built a fence around it, then they set it ablaze until its flames reached up to the sky. No greater fire had ever been lit. Then they went to Ibrahim, seized him and put him into a catapult, then they threw him into the fire. But Allah made it cool and safe for him, and after spending several days in it, he emerged unscathed. For this reason and others, Allah made him an Imam for mankind, for he offered himself to the Most Merciful, he offered his body to the flames, he offered his son as a sacrifice, and he gave his wealth to care for his guests. For all of these reasons he is beloved by the followers of all religions.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَنْجَاهُ اللَّهُ مِنَ النَّارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then Allah saved him from the fire.)</span> means, He rescued him from it by making it cool and safe for him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَاتٍ لِقَوْمٍ يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, in this are indeed signs for a people who believe.)</span> Ibrahim, peace be upon him, explains to his people that idols are incapable of doing anything,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالَ إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَانًا مَوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And <span class=\"gray\">(Ibrahim)</span> said: \"You have taken idols instead of Allah.

This will be the state of the disbelievers. As for the believers, it will be an entirely different matter.</p>"

    "text": "<p class=\"en translation\" lang=\"en\">So, Lut believed in him. He said: \"I will emigrate for the sake of my Lord. Verily, He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. <span>(26)</span>And We bestowed on him, Ishaq and Ya'qub, and We ordained among his offspring prophethood and the Book, and We granted him his reward in this world; and verily, in the Hereafter he is indeed among the righteous <span>(27)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Faith of Lut and His Emigration with Ibrahim</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah tells us that Lut believed in Ibrahim. It was said that he was the son of Ibrahim's brother, and that his name was Lut bin Haran bin Azar. None of Ibrahim's people believed in Ibrahim besides Lut and Sarah the wife of Ibrahim. But if it is asked how we may reconcile this Ayah with the Hadith narrated in the Sahih which says that when Ibrahim passed by that tyrant and he asked about Sarah and what her relationship was to him, Ibrahim said, \"My sister.\" Then he went to her and said, \"I told him that you are my sister, so do not let him think I am lying, for there are no believers on earth except for you and I, and you are my sister in faith.\" It seems – and Allah knows best – that the meaning here is, there is no other Muslim couple on earth apart from you and I. Among his people, only Lut believed in him and migrated with him to Syria, then during Ibrahim's lifetime he was sent as a Messenger to the people of Sadum <span class=\"gray\">(Sodom)</span> where he settled. We have already discussed their story and more is to come.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَقَالَ إِنِّي مُهَاجِرٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He <span class=\"gray\">(Ibrahim)</span> said: \"I will emigrate for the sake of my Lord.\")</span> It may be that the pronoun in the verb \"he said\" refers to Lut, because he was the last person mentioned before this phrase; or it may refer to Ibrahim. Ibn 'Abbas and Ad-Dahhak said that Ibrahim is the one who is referred in the phrase.</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">فَآمَنَ لَهُ لُوطٌ ۘ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So, Lut believed in him.)</span> i.e., out of all his people. Then Allah tells us that he chose to leave them so that he might be able to follow his religion openly. So he said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.)</span> Power belongs to Him and to His Messenger and to those who believe in him, and He is Wise in all that He says and does, and in all His rulings and decrees, both universal and legislative.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Qatadah said, \"They migrated together from Kutha, which is on the outskirts of Kufa, and went to Syria.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah gave Ibrahim, Ishaq and Ya'qub, and ordained Prophethood in His Offspring</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We bestowed on him, Ishaq and Ya'qub,)</span> This is like the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَمَّا اعْتَزَلَهُمْ وَمَا يَعْبُدُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ ۖ وَكُلًّا جَعَلْنَا نَبِيًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So, when he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We gave him Ishaq and Ya'qub, and each one of them We made a Prophet.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(19:49)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">That is, when he left his people, Allah gave him joy in a righteous son who was also a Prophet, to whom in turn was born, in his grandfather's lifetime, a righteous son who was also a Prophet. Allah also says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ إِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ نَافِلَةً ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We bestowed upon him Ishaq, and Ya'qub in addition)</span><span class=\"gray\">(21:72)</span> meaning, as an additional gift. This is like the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَبَشَّرْنَاهَا بِإِسْحَاقَ وَمِنْ وَرَاءِ إِسْحَاقَ يَعْقُوبَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq, and after Ishaq, of Ya'qub.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11:71)</span> meaning, to this son would be born a son during their lives, who would be a delight to them.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَعَلْنَا فِي ذُرِّيَّتِهِ النُّبُوَّةَ وَالْكِتَابَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and We ordained among his offspring prophethood and the Book,)</span> This is a tremendous blessing. Not only did Allah take him as a close friend and make him an Imam for mankind, but He also ordained prophethood and the Book among his offspring. After the time of Ibrahim there was no Prophet who was not from among his descendants. All of the Prophets of the Children of Israel were from among his descendants, from Ya'qub bin Ishaq bin Ibrahim to the last of them, 'Isa bin Maryam, who stood in the midst of his people and announced the good news of the Hashimi Qurashi Arab Prophet, the last of all the Messengers, the leader of the sons of Adam in this world and the next, whom Allah chose from the heart of the Arab nation, from the descendants of Isma'il bin Ibrahim, may peace be upon them. There is no Prophet from the line of Isma'il besides him, may the best of blessings and peace be upon him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَآتَيْنَاهُ أَجْرَهُ فِي الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَإِنَّهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ لَمِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and We granted him his reward in this world; and verily, in the Hereafter he is indeed among the righteous.)</span> Allah granted him happiness in this world that was connected to happiness in the Hereafter, for in this world he had plentiful provision, a splendid home, a beautiful and righteous wife, and he was and still is spoken of highly, for everyone loves him and regards him as a friend. Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and others said: \"He obeyed Allah in all ways.\" This is like the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِبْرَاهِيمَ الَّذِي وَفَّىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And of Ibrahim who fulfilled all.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(53:37)</span> He did all that he was commanded to do and obeyed his Lord to the utmost. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَآتَيْنَاهُ أَجْرَهُ فِي الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَإِنَّهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ لَمِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and We granted him his reward in this world; and verily, in the Hereafter he is indeed among the righteous.)</span> And He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ كَانَ أُمَّةً قَانِتًا لِلَّهِ حَنِيفًا وَلَمْ يَكُ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Ibrahim was an Ummah, Qanit to Allah, a Hanif, and he was not one of the idolators)</span> until:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَإِنَّهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ لَمِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and in the Hereafter he shall be of the righteous)</span><span class=\"gray\">(16:120-122)</span>.</p>"
