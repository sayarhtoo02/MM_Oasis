    "text": "<p class=\"en translation\" lang=\"en\">Verily, for those who have Taqwa, there will be a success <span>(31)</span>Hada'iq and vineyards <span>(32)</span>And Kawa'ib Atrab <span>(33)</span>And a cup Dihaq <span>(34)</span>No Laghw shall they hear therein, nor lying <span>(35)</span>Rewarded from your Lord with a sufficient gift <span>(36)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Great Success will be for Those Who have Taqwa</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah informs about the happy people and what He has prepared for them of esteem, and eternal pleasure. Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ مَفَازًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, for those who have Taqwa, there will be a success;)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas and Ad-Dahhak both said, \"A place of enjoyable recreation.\" Mujahid and Qatadah both said, \"They are successful and thus, they are saved from the Hellfire.\" The most obvious meaning here is the statement of Ibn 'Abbas, because Allah says after this,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">حَدَائِقَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Hada'iq)</span> And Hada'iq are gardens of palm trees and other things.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَعْنَابًا - وَكَوَاعِبَ أَتْرَابًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And vineyards, and Kawa'ib Atrab,)</span> meaning, wide-eyed maidens with fully developed breasts. Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid and others have said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَوَاعِبَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Kawa'ib)</span> \"This means round breasts. They meant by this that the breasts of these girls will be fully rounded and not sagging, because they will be virgins, equal in age. This means that they will only have one age.\" The explanation of this has already been mentioned in Surat Al-Waqi'ah. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَكَأْسًا دِهَاقًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And a cup Dihaq.)</span> Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Continuously filled.\" 'Ikrimah said, \"Pure.\" Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, and Ibn Zayd all said,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">دِهَاقًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Dihaq)</span> \"This means completely filled.\" Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّا يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْوًا وَلَا كِذَّابًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(No Laghw shall they hear therein, nor lying;)</span> This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّا لَغْوٌ فِيهَا وَلَا تَأْثِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Free from any Laghw, and free from sin.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(52:23)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, there will not be any vain, worthless speech therein, nor any sinful lying. Rather, it will be the abode of peace, and everything that is in it will be free of any shortcomings. Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">جَزَاءً مِّن رَّبِّكَ عَطَاءً حِسَابًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Rewarded from your Lord with a sufficient gift.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, 'this that We have mentioned to you is what Allah will reward them with, and they will be given it by His favor and from Him. It will be a kindness, mercy, gift, and recompense from Him. It will be sufficient, suitable, comprehensive and abundant.' The Arabs say, \"He gave me and he sufficed me.\" This means that he sufficiently provided for me.\" From this comes the saying, \"Allah is sufficient for me.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَّبِّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا الرَّحْمَٰنِ ۖ لَا يَمْلِكُونَ مِنْهُ خِطَابًا - يَوْمَ يَقُومُ الرُّوحُ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ صَفًّا ۖ لَّا يَتَكَلَّمُونَ إِلَّا مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَقَالَ صَوَابًا - ذَٰلِكَ الْيَوْمُ الْحَقُّ ۖ فَمَن شَاءَ اتَّخَذَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِ مَآبًا - إِنَّا أَنذَرْنَاكُمْ عَذَابًا قَرِيبًا يَوْمَ يَنظُرُ الْمَرْءُ مَا قَدَّمَتْ يَدَاهُ وَيَقُولُ الْكَافِرُ يَا لَيْتَنِي كُنتُ تُرَابًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(37. The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and whatsoever is in between them, the Most Gracious, with Whom they cannot dare to speak.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(38. The Day that Ar-Ruh and the angels will stand forth in rows, they will not speak except him whom Ar-Rahman allows, and he will speak what is right.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(39. That is the True Day. So, whosoever wills, let him seek a place with His Lord!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(40. Verily, We have warned you of a near torment – the Day when man will see that which his hands have sent forth, and the disbeliever will say: \"Woe to me! Would that I were dust!\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">No one will dare to speak before Allah – not even the Angels - without first receiving Permission</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah informs of His magnificence and His majesty, and that He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and whatever is in them and between them. He explains that He is the Most Gracious, Whose mercy covers all things. Then He says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا يَمْلِكُونَ مِنْهُ خِطَابًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(With Whom they cannot dare to speak.)</span> meaning, no one is able to begin addressing Him except by His permission. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:255)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It is also similar to His statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَأْتِ لَا تَكَلَّمُ نَفْسٌ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day when it comes, no person shall speak except by His leave.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11:105)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَقُومُ الرُّوحُ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ صَفًّا ۖ لَّا يَتَكَلَّمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Day that Ar-Ruh and the angels will stand forth in rows, they will not speak)</span><span class=\"gray\">(78:38)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The word Ruh here is referring to the angel Jibril. This has been said by Ash-Sha'bi, Sa'id bin Jubayr and Ad-Dahhak. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الْأَمِينُ - عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ لِتَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُنذِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Which the trustworthy Ruh has brought down. Upon your heart that you may be of the warners.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(26:193-194)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Muqatil bin Hayyan said, \"The Ruh is the noblest of the angels, the closest of them to the Lord, and the one who delivers the revelation.\"</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِلَّا مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ الرَّحْمَٰنُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(except him whom Ar-Rahman allows,)</span> This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَأْتِ لَا تَكَلَّمُ نَفْسٌ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day when it comes, no person shall speak except by His leave.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11:105)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is similar to what has been confirmed in the Sahih, that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا يَتَكَلَّمُ يَوْمَئِذٍ إِلَّا الرُّسُل</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And none will speak on that Day except the Messengers.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالَ صَوَابًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and he will speak what is right.)</span> meaning, the truth. And from the truth is the fact that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah. This is as Abu Salih and 'Ikrimah both said. In reference to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَٰلِكَ الْيَوْمُ الْحَقُّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That is the True Day.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">فَمَن شَاءَ اتَّخَذَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِ مَآبًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So, whosoever wills, let him seek a place with His Lord!)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, a place of return, a path that leads to Him, and a way that he may pass by to get to Him.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Day of Judgement is Near</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّا أَنذَرْنَاكُمْ عَذَابًا قَرِيبًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, We have warned you of a near torment)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, the Day of Judgement. It is mentioned here to emphasize the fact that its occurrence has become close, because everything that is coming will certainly come to pass.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَنظُرُ الْمَرْءُ مَا قَدَّمَتْ يَدَاهُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(the Day when man will see that which his hands have sent forth,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, all of his deeds will be presented to him – the good and bad, and the old and new. This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَوَجَدُوا مَا عَمِلُوا حَاضِرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they will find all that they did, placed before them.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(18:49)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It is also similar to His statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُنَبَّأُ الْإِنسَانُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(75:13)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَقُولُ الْكَافِرُ يَا لَيْتَنِي كُنتُ تُرَابًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and the disbeliever will say: \"Woe to me! Would that I were dust!\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, the disbeliever on that Day will wish that he had only been dust in the worldly life. He will wish that he had not been created and that he had never come into existence. This will be when he sees the torment of Allah and he looks at his wicked deeds that will be written down against him by the noble righteous scribes among angels. It has been said that he will only wish for that when Allah passes judgement between all of the animals that were in the worldly life. He will rectify matters between them with His just wisdom that does not wrong anyone. Even the hornless sheep will be allowed to avenge itself against the sheep with horns. Then, when the judgement between them is finished, He <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span> will say to them <span class=\"gray\">(the animals)</span>, \"Be dust.\" So they will all become dust. Upon witnessing this the disbeliever will say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا لَيْتَنِي كُنتُ تُرَابًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Would that I were dust!)</span> meaning, 'I wish I was an animal so that I would be returned to dust.' Something of similar meaning to this has been reported in the well-known Hadith about the Sur. There are also narrations recorded from Abu Hurayrah, 'Abdullah bin 'Amr, and others concerning this.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat An-Naba'. And all praise and thanks are due to Allah. He is the Giver of success and protection from error.</p>"
