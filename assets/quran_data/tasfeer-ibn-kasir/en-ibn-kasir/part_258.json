These are indeed the heirs.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11. Who shall inherit Firdaws. They shall dwell therein forever.)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Success is for the believers whose qualities are described here</h2></div><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Successful indeed are the believers)</span> means, they have attained victory and are blessed, for they have succeeded. These are the believers who have the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِي صَلَاتِهِمْ خَاشِعُونَ</p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who with their Salah are Khashi'un.)</span> 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas said:</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">خَاشِعُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"<span class=\"gray\">(Khashi'un)</span> means those with fear and with tranquillity.\" This was also narrated from Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Az-Zuhri. It was reported from 'Ali bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, that Khushu' means the Khushu' of the heart. This was also the view of Ibrahim An-Nakha'i. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"Their Khushu' was in their hearts.\" So they lowered their gaze and were humble towards others. Khushu' in prayer is only attained by the one who has emptied his heart totally, who does not pay attention to anything else besides it, and who prefers it above all else. At that point it becomes a delight and a joy for eyes, as in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and An-Nasa'i from Anas, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حُبِّبَ إِلَيَّ الطِّيبُ وَالنِّسَاءُ، وَجُعِلَتْ قُرَّةُ عَيْنِي فِي الصَّلَاةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Fragrance and women have been made dear to me, and Salah was made the joy of my eye.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنِ اللَّغْوِ مُعْرِضُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who turn away from Al-Laghw.)</span> refers to falsehood, which includes Shirk and sin, and any words or deeds that are of no benefit. As Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَإِذَا مَرُّوا بِاللَّغْوِ مَرُّوا كِرَامًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if they pass by Al-Laghw, they pass by it with dignity)</span><span class=\"gray\">(25:72)</span>. Qatadah said: \"By Allah, there came to them from Allah that which kept them away from that <span class=\"gray\">(evil)</span>.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِلزَّكَاةِ فَاعِلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who pay the Zakah.)</span> Most commentators say that the meaning here is the Zakah that is paid on wealth, even though this Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and Zakah was ordained in Al-Madinah in the year 2 H. The apparent meaning is that the Zakah that was instituted in Al-Madinah is the one based upon the Nusub and the specific amounts, apart from which it seems that the basic principle of Zakah was enjoined in Makkah. As Allah says in Surat Al-An'am, which was also revealed in Makkah:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَآتُوا حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but pay the due thereof on the day of their harvest,)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:141)</span> It could be that what is meant here by Zakah is purification of the soul from Shirk and filth, as in the Ayah:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ زَكَّاهَا - وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنْ دَسَّاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Indeed he succeeds who purifies himself <span class=\"gray\">(Zakkaha)</span>. And indeed he fails who corrupts himself.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(91:9-10)</span> It could be that both meanings are intended, purification of the soul and of one's wealth, because that is part of the purification of the soul, and the true believer is one who pays attention to both matters. And Allah knows best.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَافِظُونَ - إِلَّا عَلَىٰ أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ - فَمَنِ ابْتَغَىٰ وَرَاءَ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْعَادُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who guard their private parts. Except from their wives and their right hand possessions, for then, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.)</span> means, those who protect their private parts from unlawful actions and do not do that which Allah has forbidden; fornication and homosexuality, and do not approach anyone except the wives whom Allah has made permissible for them or their right hand possessions from the captives. One who seeks what Allah has made permissible for him is not to be blamed and there is no sin on him. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ - فَمَنِ ابْتَغَىٰ وَرَاءَ ذَٰلِكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that)</span> meaning, other than a wife or slave girl,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْعَادُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(then those are the transgressors.)</span> meaning, aggressors.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِأَمَانَاتِهِمْ وَعَهْدِهِمْ رَاعُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat and to their covenants)</span> When they are entrusted with something, they do not betray that trust, but they fulfill it, and when they make a promise or make a pledge, they are true to their word. This is not like the hypocrites about whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">آيَةُ الْمُنَافِقِ ثَلَاثٌ: إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإِذَا وَعَدَ أَخْلَفَ، وَإِذَا اؤْتُمِنَ خَانَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَلَىٰ صَلَوَاتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who strictly guard their Salawat.)</span> means, they persistently offer their prayers at their appointed times, as Ibn Mas'ud said: \"I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, 'O Messenger of Allah, which deed is most beloved to Allah?' He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الصَّلَاةُ عَلَى وَقْتِهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Prayer at the appointed time.)</span> I said, 'Then what?' He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِرُّ الْوَالِدَيْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Kindness to one's parents.)</span> I said, 'Then what?' He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Jihad in the way of Allah.)</span> It was recorded in the Two Sahihs. Qatadah said: \"At the fixed times, with the proper bowing and prostration.\" Allah begins and ends this list of praiseworthy qualities with Salah, which is indicative of its virtue, as the Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اسْتَقِيمُوا وَلَنْ تُحْصُوا، وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ خَيْرَ أَعْمَالِكُمُ الصَّلَاةُ، وَلَا يُحَافِظُ عَلَى الْوُضُوءِ إِلَّا مُؤْمِنٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Adhere to righteousness, you will never be able encompass it all. Know that the best of your deeds is Salah. None will preserve his Wuddu' except the believer.)</span> Having described them with these praiseworthy characteristics and righteous deeds, Allah then says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْوَارِثُونَ - الَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ الْفِرْدَوْسَ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(These are indeed the heirs. Who shall inherit Firdaws. They shall dwell therein forever.)</span> It was recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا سَأَلْتُمُ اللهَ الْجَنَّةَ فَاسْأَلُوهُ الْفِرْدَوْسَ، فَإِنَّهُ أَعْلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَأَوْسَطُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَمِنْهُ تَفَجَّرُ أَنْهَارُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَفَوْقَهُ عَرْشُ الرَّحْمٰنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise, and above it is the <span class=\"gray\">(Mighty)</span> Throne of the Most Merciful.)</span> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا وَلَهُ مَنْزِلَانِ: مَنْزِلٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَمَنْزِلٌ فِي النَّارِ، فَإِنْ مَاتَ فَدَخَلَ النَّارَ وَرِثَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ مَنْزِلَهُ، فَذَلِكَ قَوْلُهُ:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْوَارِثُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is not one among you who does not have two homes, a home in Paradise and a home in Hell. If he dies and enters Hell, the people of Paradise will inherit his home, and this is what Allah said: <span class=\"gray\">(These are indeed the heirs.)</span></span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Jurayj narrated from Layth from Mujahid:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْوَارِثُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(These are indeed the heirs.)</span> \"The believers will inherit the homes of the disbelievers because they were created to worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate. So when these believers did what was enjoined on them of worship, and the disbelievers neglected to do that which they were commanded to do and for which they had been created, the believers gained the share that they would have been given if they had obeyed their Lord. Indeed, they will be given more than that as well.\" This is what was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Burdah, from his father, from the Prophet ﷺ who said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَجِيءُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ نَاسٌ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ بِذُنُوبٍ أَمْثَالِ الْجِبَالِ، فَيَغْفِرُهَا اللهُ لَهُمْ وَيَضَعُهَا عَلَى الْيَهُودِ وَالنَّصَارَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Some of the Muslims will come on the Day of Resurrection with sins like mountains, but Allah will forgive them and put <span class=\"gray\">(their burden of sin)</span> on the Jews and Christians.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">According to another version: the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا كَانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَامَةِ دَفَعَ اللهُ لِكُلِّ مُسْلِمٍ يَهُودِيًّا أَوْ نَصْرَانِيًّا، فَيُقَالُ: هَذَا فِكَاكُكَ مِنَ النَّارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah will appoint for every Muslim a Jew or Christian, and it will be said, \"This is your ransom from the Fire.\")</span> 'Umar bin 'Abd Al-'Aziz asked Abu Burdah to swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other God, three times, that his father told him that from the Prophet ﷺ, and he swore that oath. I say: this Ayah is like Allah's saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">تِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِي نُورِثُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا مَنْ كَانَ تَقِيًّا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who have had Taqwa.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(19:63)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِي أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which you used to do.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(43:72)</span></p>"
