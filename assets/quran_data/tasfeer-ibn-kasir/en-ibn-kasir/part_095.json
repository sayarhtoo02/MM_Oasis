    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And <span class=\"gray\">(remember)</span> when Ibrahim said: \"O my Lord! Make this city <span class=\"gray\">(Makkah)</span> one of peace and security, and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols <span>(35)</span>\"O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind. But whoso follows me, he verily, is of me. And whoso disobeys me, still You are indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful <span>(36)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Ibrahim's Supplication to Allah when He brought Isma'il to Makkah</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah mentions here, while bringing forth more evidences against Arab polytheists, that the Sacred House in Makkah was established on the worship of Allah alone, without partners. He also states that Ibrahim, who establsihed the city, has disowned those who worship others besides Allah, and that he begged Allah to make Makkah peaceful and secure,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَٰذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O my Lord! Make this city <span class=\"gray\">(Makkah)</span> of peace and security,)</span> and Allah accepted his supplication. Allah said in other Ayat,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا حَرَمًا آمِنًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Have they not seen that We have made <span class=\"gray\">(Makkah)</span> a secure sanctuary.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[29:67]</span> and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِي بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكًا وَهُدًى لِّلْعَالَمِينَ - فِيهِ آيَاتٌ بَيِّنَاتٌ مَّقَامُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ ۖ وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ آمِنًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the first House <span class=\"gray\">(of worship)</span> appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah <span class=\"gray\">(Makkah)</span>, full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-'Alamin. In it are manifest signs, the Maqam of Ibrahim; whosoever enters it, he attains security.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[3:96-97]</span> Allah said here that Ibrahim supplicated,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَٰذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O my Lord! Make this city <span class=\"gray\">(Makkah)</span> a of peace and security,)</span> saying, \"this city\", after he established it, and this is why he said afterwards,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي وَهَبَ لِي عَلَى الْكِبَرِ إِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(All praise is due to Allah, Who has given me in old age Isma'il and Ishaq.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[14:39]</span> It is well-known that Isma'il was thirteen years older than Ishaq. When Ibrahim took Isma'il and his mother to Makkah, while Isma'il was still young enough to nurse, he supplicated to Allah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَٰذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O my Lord! Make this city <span class=\"gray\">(Makkah)</span> a place of peace and security.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:126]</span> as we in explained in Surat Al-Baqarah. Ibrahim then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ الْأَصْنَامَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.)</span> It is proper for whoever supplicates to Allah to also ask for the benefit of his parents and offspring, as well as himself. Ibrahim next mentioned that many among mankind were led astray because of idols, and he disowned those who worship them and referred their matter to Allah; if Allah wills, He will punish them, and if He wills, He will forgive them. 'Isa, peace be upon him, said similar words,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِن تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ ۖ وَإِن تَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ فَإِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If You punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, verily, You, only You are the Almighty, the All-Wise.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[5:118]</span> This supplication refers this and all matters to Allah, not that it is actually going to happen. 'Abdullah bin 'Amr narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited Ibrahim's supplication,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ النَّاسِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind.)</span>, and the supplication of 'Isa,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">إِن تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If You punish them, they are Your servants.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[5:118]</span> then raised his hands and said,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">اللَّهُمَّ أُمَّتِي، اللَّهُمَّ أُمَّتِي، اللَّهُمَّ أُمَّتِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Allah, Save my Ummah! O, Allah, Save my Ummah! O, Allah, Save my Ummah!)</span> and cried. Allah said to the angel Jibril, \"O Jibril, go to Muhammad, and Your Lord has more knowledge, and ask him what makes him cry.\" Jibril came to the Prophet ﷺ and asked him, and he repeated to him what he said <span class=\"gray\">(in his supplication)</span>. Allah said, \"Go to Muhammad and tell him this; 'We will make you pleased with your Ummah, O Muhammad, and will not treat them in a way you dislike.'\"</p>"

This prayer, it appears, was said after the House was built, begging Allah and seeking His favor, and He is the Exalted and Most Honored. Ibrahim said here,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عِندَ بَيْتِكَ الْمُحَرَّمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(by Your Sacred House...)</span> then he,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبَّنَا لِيُقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O our Lord, that they may perform Salah.)</span> Ibn Jarir At-Tabari commented that this, \"Refers to his earlier statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْمُحَرَّمِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(the Sacred...)</span>,\" meaning, 'You have made this House Sacred so that people establish the prayer next to it,'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَاجْعَلْ أَفْئِدَةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ تَهْوِي إِلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So fill some hearts among men with love towards them,)</span> Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid and Sa'id bin Jubayr said, \"Had Ibrahim said, 'The hearts of mankind', Persians, Romans, the Jews, the Christians and all other people would have gathered around it.\" However, Ibrahim said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مِّنَ النَّاسِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(among men)</span>, thus making it exclusive to Muslims only.
