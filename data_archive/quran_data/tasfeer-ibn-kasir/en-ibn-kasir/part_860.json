    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Jews say: \"Allah's Hand is tied up.\" Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends as He wills. Verily, the revelation that has come to you from your Lord makes many of them increase in rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it; and they <span class=\"gray\">(ever)</span> strive to make mischief on the earth. And Allah does not like the mischief-makers <span>(64)</span>And if only the People of the Scripture had believed and had Taqwa, We would indeed have expiated for them their sins and admitted them to Gardens of pleasure <span class=\"gray\">(in Paradise)</span><span>(65)</span>And if only they had acted according to the Tawrah, the Injil, and what has <span class=\"gray\">(now)</span> been sent down to them from their Lord <span class=\"gray\">(the Qur'an)</span>, they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet. And among them is a Muqtasid Ummah, but for most of them; evil is their work <span>(66)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Jews Say That Allah's Hand is Tied up!</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah states that the Jews, may Allah's continuous curses descend on them until the Day of Resurrection, describe Him as a miser. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him. The Jews also claim that Allah is poor, while they are rich. 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas commented on Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالَتِ الْيَهُودُ يَدُ اللَّهِ مَغْلُولَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Jews say, \"Allah's Hand is tied up.\")</span> \"They do not mean that Allah's Hand is literally tied up. Rather, they mean that He is a miser and does not spend from what He has. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him.\" Similar was reported from Mujahid, 'Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَجْعَلْ يَدَكَ مَغْلُولَةً إِلَىٰ عُنُقِكَ وَلَا تَبْسُطْهَا كُلَّ الْبَسْطِ فَتَقْعُدَ مَلُومًا مَّحْسُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And let not your hand be tied <span class=\"gray\">(like a miser)</span> to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach <span class=\"gray\">(like a spendthrift)</span>, so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[17:29]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In this Ayah, Allah prohibits stinginess and extravagance, which includes unnecessary and improper expenditures. Allah describes stinginess by saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَجْعَلْ يَدَكَ مَغْلُولَةً إِلَىٰ عُنُقِكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And let not your hand be tied <span class=\"gray\">(like a miser)</span> to your neck.)</span> Therefore, this is the meaning that the Jews meant, may Allah's curses be on them. 'Ikrimah said that this Ayah was revealed about Finhas, one of the Jews, may Allah curse him. We mentioned before that Finhas said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> إِنَّ اللَّهَ فَقِيرٌ وَنَحْنُ أَغْنِيَاءُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Truly, Allah is poor and we are rich!\")</span> and that Abu Bakr smacked him. Allah has refuted what the Jews attribute to Him and cursed them in retaliation for their lies and fabrications about Him. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">غُلَّتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَلُعِنُوا بِمَا قَالُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered.)</span> What Allah said occurred, for the Jews are indeed miserly, envious, cowards and tremendously humiliated. Allah said in other Ayat,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمْ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِّنَ الْمُلْكِ فَإِذًا لَّا يُؤْتُونَ النَّاسَ نَقِيرًا - أَمْ يَحْسُدُونَ النَّاسَ عَلَىٰ مَا آتَاهُمُ اللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ فَقَدْ آتَيْنَا آلَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَآتَيْنَاهُم مُّلْكًا عَظِيمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or have they a share in the dominion? Then in that case they would not give mankind even a Naqir. Or do they envy men for what Allah has given them of His bounty? Then, We had already given the family of Ibrahim the Book and the Hikmah, and conferred upon them a great kingdom.)</span> and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الذِّلَّةُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Indignity is put over them.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[3:112]</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Allah's Hands are Widely Outstretched</h2></div><p lang=\"el-Latn\" class=\"el-Latn \">Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَلْ يَدَاهُ مَبْسُوطَتَانِ يُنفِقُ كَيْفَ يَشَاءُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends <span class=\"gray\">(of His bounty)</span> as He wills.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah's favors are ample, His bounty unlimited, as He owns the treasures of everything. Any good that reaches His servants is from Him alone, without partners. He has created everything that we need by night or by day, while traveling or at home and in all situations and conditions. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَآتَاكُم مِّن كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ وَإِن تَعُدُّوا نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ لَا تُحْصُوهَا إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَظَلُومٌ كَفَّارٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He gave you of all that you asked for, and if you count the blessings of Allah, never will you be able to count them. Verily, man is indeed an extreme wrongdoer, an extreme ingrate.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There are many other Ayat on this subject. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said that 'Abdur-Razzaq narrated to him that Ma'mar said that Hammam bin Munabbih said, \"This is what Abu Hurayrah narrated to us that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ يَمِينَ اللهِ مَلْأَى، لَا يَغِيضُهَا نَفَقَةٌ، سَحَّاءُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ، أَرَأَيْتُمْ مَا أَنْفَقَ مُنْذُ خَلَقَ السَّمٰوَات وَالْأَرْضَ، فَإِنَّهُ لَمْ يَغِضْ مَا فِي يَمِينِهِ - قال - : وَعَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ، وَفِي يَدِهِ الْأَخُرى الْقَبْضُ يَرْفَعُ وَيَخْفِضُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah's Right Hand is perfectly full, and no amount of spending can decrease what He has, even though He spends by night and by day. Do you see how much Allah has spent since He created the heavens and earth? Yet surely it has not decreased what He has in His Right Hand. His Throne is over the water and in His Other Hand is the hold by which He raises and lowers.)</span> He also said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> قُولُ اللهُ تَعَالىٰ: أَنْفِقْ، أُنْفِقْ عَلَيْكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah said, 'Spend and I will spend on you.')</span>\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Revelation to the Muslims only Adds to the Transgression and Disbelief of the Jews</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَيَزِيدَنَّ كَثِيرًا مِّنْهُم مَّا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ طُغْيَانًا وَكُفْرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the revelation that has come to you from your Lord makes many of them increase in rebellion and disbelief.)</span> meaning, the bounty that comes to you, O Muhammad, is a calamity for your enemies, the Jews and their kind. The more the revelation increases the believers in faith, good works, and beneficial knowledge, the more the disbelievers increase in envy for you and your Ummah, the more they increase in Tughyan – which is to exceed the ordained limits for things – and in disbelief – meaning denial of you. Allah said in other Ayat,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ هُوَ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا هُدًى وَشِفَاءٌ وَالَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ فِي آذَانِهِمْ وَقْرٌ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَمًى أُولَٰئِكَ يُنَادَوْنَ مِن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness <span class=\"gray\">(deafness)</span> in their ears, and it is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[41:44]</span> and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْآنِ مَا هُوَ شِفَاءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَلَا يَزِيدُ الظَّالِمِينَ إِلَّا خَسَارًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We send down of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe, and it increases wrongdoers in nothing but loss.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[17:82]</span> Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَلْقَيْنَا بَيْنَهُمُ الْعَدَاوَةَ وَالْبَغْضَاءَ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We have put enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, their hearts are never united. Rather, their various groups and sects will always have enmity and hatred for each other, because they do not agree on the truth, and because they opposed you and denied you. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلَّمَا أَوْقَدُوا نَارًا لِّلْحَرْبِ أَطْفَأَهَا اللَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it;)</span> means, every time they try to plot against you and kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it and makes their plots turn against them. Therefore, their evil plots will return to harm them.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَسْعَوْنَ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَسَادًا وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُفْسِدِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and they <span class=\"gray\">(ever)</span> strive to make mischief on earth. And Allah does not like the mischief-makers.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It is their habit to always strive to cause mischief on the earth, and Allah does not like those with such behavior.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Had the People of the Book Adhered to their Book, they Would Have Acquired the Good of this Life and the Hereafter</h2></div><p lang=\"el-Latn\" class=\"el-Latn \">Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ آمَنُوا وَاتَّقَوْا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if only the People of the Scripture had believed and had Taqwa...)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Consequently, had the People of the Book believed in Allah and His Messenger ﷺ and avoided the sins and prohibitions that they committed;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> لَكَفَّرْنَا عَنْهُمْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ وَلَأَدْخَلْنَاهُمْ جَنَّاتِ النَّعِيمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We would indeed have expiated for them their sins and admitted them to Gardens of pleasure <span class=\"gray\">(in Paradise)</span>.)</span> meaning We would have removed the dangers from them and granted them their objectives.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ أَقَامُوا التَّوْرَاةَ وَالْإِنجِيلَ وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِم مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if only they had acted according to the Tawrah, the Injil, and what has <span class=\"gray\">(now)</span> been sent down to them from their Lord,)</span> meaning, the Qur'an, as Ibn 'Abbas and others said.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَأَكَلُوا مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَمِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِهِم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Had they adhered to the Books that they have with them which they inherited from the Prophets, without altering or changing these Books, these would have directed them to follow the truth and implement the revelation that Allah sent Muhammad ﷺ with. These Books testify to the Prophet's truth and command that he must be followed. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَأَكَلُوا مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَمِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِهِم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet.)</span> refers to the tremendous provision that would have descended to them from the sky and grown for them on the earth. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَهْلَ الْقُرَىٰ آمَنُوا وَاتَّقَوْا لَفَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَرَكَاتٍ مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if the people of the towns had believed and had Taqwa, certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[7:96]</span> Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مِّنْهُمْ أُمَّةٌ مُّقْتَصِدَةٌ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ سَاءَ مَا يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And among them is a Muqtasid Ummah, but for most of them; evil is their work.)</span> is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِن قَوْمِ مُوسَىٰ أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And of the people of Musa there is a community who lead <span class=\"gray\">(the men)</span> with truth and establish justice therewith.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[7:159]</span> and His statement about the followers of 'Isa, peace be upon him,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَآتَيْنَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مِنْهُمْ أَجْرَهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So We gave those among them who believed, their <span class=\"gray\">(due)</span> reward.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[57:27]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, Allah gave them the highest grade of Iqtisad, which is the middle course, given to this Ummah. Above them there is the grade of Sabiqun, as Allah described in His statement;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا الْكِتَابَ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا فَمِنْهُمْ ظَالِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ وَمِنْهُم مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِالْخَيْرَاتِ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الْفَضْلُ الْكَبِيرُ - جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ يَدْخُلُونَهَا يُحَلَّوْنَ فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٍ وَلُؤْلُؤًا وَلِبَاسُهُمْ فِيهَا حَرِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose. Then of them are some who wrong themselves, and of them are some who follow a middle course, and of them are some who, by Allah's permission, are Sabiq <span class=\"gray\">(foremost)</span> in good deeds. That itself is indeed a great grace. 'Adn <span class=\"gray\">(Eden)</span> Paradise <span class=\"gray\">(everlasting Gardens)</span> will they enter, therein will they be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments there will be of silk.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[35:32-33]</span></p>"
