Various things happened to him, such as riding on a ship at sea, being swallowed by a <span class=\"gray\">(large)</span> fish, the fish carrying him off into the ocean, being in the darkness and depth of the sea and hearing the sea's and its dwellers glorification of the Most High, the Most Able <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span>. For He <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span> is the One Whose execution of divine decree cannot be resisted. After all of this, he <span class=\"gray\">(Yunus)</span> called out from the layers of darkness,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> أَنْ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنْتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"That none has the right to be worshipped but You <span class=\"gray\">(O Allah)</span>, Glorified <span class=\"gray\">(and Exalted)</span> are You!

And thus We do deliver the believers.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(21:88)</span> Allah also says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَوْلَا أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ الْمُسَبِّحِينَ - لَلَبِثَ فِي بَطْنِهِ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Had he not been of them who glorify Allah, he would have indeed remained inside its belly <span class=\"gray\">(the fish)</span> till the Day when they are resurrected.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(37:143-144)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So here <span class=\"gray\">(in this Surah)</span>, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذْ نَادَىٰ وَهُوَ مَكْظُومٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(when he cried out <span class=\"gray\">(to Us)</span> while he was Makzum.)</span> Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid and As-Suddi, all said, \"while he was distressed.\" Then Allah goes on to say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَاجْتَبَاهُ رَبُّهُ فَجَعَلَهُ مِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then his Lord chose him and made him of the righteous.)</span> Imam Ahmad recorded from 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا يَنْبَغِي لِأَحَدٍ أَنْ يَقُولَ: أَنَا خَيْرٌ مِنْ يُونُسَ بْنِ مَتَّى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is not befitting for anyone to say that I am better than Yunus bin Matta.)</span> Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith and it is in the Two Sahihs reported from Abu Hurayrah. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنْ يَكَادُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَيُزْلِقُونَكَ بِأَبْصَارِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes)</span> Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid and others have said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيُزْلِقُونَكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(would make you slip)</span> \"In order to have some effect on you.\"</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\"> بِأَبْصَارِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(with their eyes)</span> meaning, 'they will affect you by looking at you with their eyes <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., the evil eye)</span>.' This means 'they are jealous of you due to their hatred of you, and were it not for Allah's protection of you, defending you against them <span class=\"gray\">(then their evil eye would harm you)</span>.'</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Effect of the Evil Eye is Real</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In this Ayah is a proof that the effect of the evil eye and its affliction by the command of Allah is real. Many Hadiths have been reported concerning this through numerous routes of transmission. </p><p lang=\"so\" class=\"so \">The Hadith of Buraydah bin Al-Husayb</p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">Abu 'Abdullah bin Majah recorded from Buraydah bin Al-Husayb that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا رُقْيَةَ إِلَّا مِنْ عَيْنٍ أَوْ حُمَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is no Ruqyah except to cure the evil eye and the sting.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is how Ibn Majah recorded this Hadith. Imam Muslim also recorded this Hadith in his Sahih on the authority of Buraydah himself, but he did not attribute it to the Prophet ﷺ. There is a story concerning this incident <span class=\"gray\">(as reported by Buraydah in Sahih Muslim)</span>, and At-Tirmidhi recorded the Hadith in this manner <span class=\"gray\">(like Muslim's version)</span>. This Hadith has also been recorded by Imam Al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi on the authority of 'Imran bin Husayn, however, he did not attribute it to the Prophet ﷺ. 'Imran's wording is,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا رُقْيَةَ إِلَّا مِنْ عَيْنٍ أَوْ حُمَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is no Ruqyah except to cure the evil eye and the sting.)</span>\" Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْعَيْنُ حَقٌّ وَلَوْ كَانَ شَيْءٌ سَابَقَ الْقَدَرَ سَبَقَتِ الْعَيْنُ وَإِذَا اسْتُغْسِلْتُمْ فَاغْسِلُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The evil eye is real. If anything were to overtake the divine decree <span class=\"gray\">(and change it)</span>, then it would be the evil eye. And if you perform Ghusl <span class=\"gray\">(to remove the evil eye)</span> then wash well.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Muslim was alone in recording this Hadith, as Al-Bukhari did not mention it. It is reported from Ibn 'Abbas that he said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to invoke Allah's protection for Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn <span class=\"gray\">(his grandsons)</span> by saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُعِيذُكُمَا بِكَلِمَاتِ اللهِ التَّامَّةِ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْطَانٍ وَهَامَّةٍ، وَمِنْ كُلِّ عَيْنٍ لَامَّةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I seek protection for you two by the perfect Words of Allah from every Shaytan, and dangerous creature, and from every eye that is evil.)</span> Then he would say:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَكَذَا كَانَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ يُعَوِّذُ إِسْحَاقَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ عَلَيْهِمَا السَّلَامُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Thus, did Ibrahim used to seek protection for Ishaq and Isma'il <span class=\"gray\">(his sons)</span>.)</span>\" This Hadith was recorded by Al-Bukhari and the Sunan compilers.</p><p lang=\"so\" class=\"so \">The Hadith of Abu Umamah As'ad bin Sahl bin Hunayf</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Majah recorded from Abu Umamah As'ad bin Sahl bin Hunayf that 'Amir bin Rabi'ah passed by Sahl bin Hunayf while he was bathing and he said, \"I haven't seen the skin of a beautiful virgin girl nicer than this that I see today <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., commenting on how nice Sahl's skin was)</span>.\" So he did not leave before he <span class=\"gray\">(Sahl)</span> fell down on the ground. So he was brought to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and it was said to him <span class=\"gray\">(the Prophet ﷺ)</span> that Sahl had been afflicted by a seizure. The Prophet ﷺ then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ تَتَّهِمُونَ بِهِ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who do you blame <span class=\"gray\">(or hold responsible)</span> for this?)</span> The people replied, \"\"Amir bin Rabi'ah.\" Then the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَلَامَ يَقْتُلُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ؟ إِذَا رَأَىٰ أَحَدُكُمْ مِنْ أَخِيهِ مَا يُعْجِبُهُ فَلْيَدْعُ لَهُ بِالْبَرَكَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Would one of you knowingly kill his brother? If one of you sees something of his brother that he likes, then let him supplicate for blessings for him.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then the Prophet ﷺ called for some water and he commanded 'Amir to perform Wudu' with the water. So he washed his face, his hands up to his two elbows, his two knees, and the inside of his Izar. Then the Prophet ﷺ commanded him to pour the water over Sahl. Sufyan said that Ma'mar related from Az-Zuhri that he said, \"The Prophet ﷺ ordered him to turn the water pot over <span class=\"gray\">(empty its contents over)</span> him <span class=\"gray\">(Sahl)</span> from behind him.\" An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith through different routes from Abu Umamah with the wording, \"And he turned the pot over pouring its contents over him <span class=\"gray\">(Sahl)</span> from behind him.\"</p><p lang=\"sw\" class=\"sw \">The Hadith of Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to seek refuge from the evil eye of the Jinns and the evil eye of humans. Then when the Mu'awwidhatan were revealed, he used them <span class=\"gray\">(for seeking protection)</span> and abandoned everything else. This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Another Hadith from Abu Sa'id </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Sa'id that Jibril came to the Prophet ﷺ and said, \"O Muhammad, are you suffering from any ailment?\" The Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">نَعَمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yes)</span>.\" Then Jibril said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ يُؤْذِيكَ، وَمِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ وَعَيْنٍ تَشْنِيكَ، وَاللهُ يَشْفِيكَ، بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing <span class=\"gray\">(Ruqyah)</span>, from everything that bothers you, from the evil of every soul and every evil eye that hates you, may Allah cure you, in the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Hadith has been recorded by Muslim and the Sunan compilers except for Abu Dawud. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Sa'id or Jabir bin 'Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was bothered by some illness, and Jibril came to him and said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِاسْمِ اللهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ يُؤْذِيكَ، مِنْ كُلِّ حَاسِدٍ وَعَيْنٍ، اللهُ يَشْفِيكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In the Name of Allah I pray over you for healing <span class=\"gray\">(Ruqyah)</span>, from everything that bothers you, from every envious person and evil eye, may Allah cure you.)</span></p><p lang=\"fil\" class=\"fil \">The Hadith of Abu Hurayrah</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الْعَيْنَ حَقٌّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the evil eye is real.)</span></p><p lang=\"fil\" class=\"fil \">Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this Hadith as well. Ibn Majah recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْعَيْنُ حَقٌّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The evil eye is real.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Majah was alone in recording this Hadith.</p><p lang=\"so\" class=\"so \">The Hadith of Asma' bint 'Umays</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded from 'Ubayd bin Rifa'ah Az-Zuraqi that Asma' said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Verily, Bani Ja'far are afflicted with the evil eye; should I seek to have Ruqyah?\" The Prophet ﷺ replied,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نَعَمْ فَلَوْ كَانَ شَيْءٌ يَسْبِقُ الْقَدَرَ لَسَبَقَتْهُ الْعَيْنُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yes, for if anything could overcome the divine decree, it would be the evil eye.)</span> This Hadith has been recorded like this by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said concerning it, \"Hasan Sahih.\"</p><p lang=\"sw\" class=\"sw \">The Hadith of 'A'ishah</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Majah recorded from 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered her to have Ruqyah performed as a cure against the evil eye. This was reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">The Hadith of Sahl bin Hunayf </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Umamah bin Sahl bin Hunayf that his father informed him that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ went out on a journey in the direction of Makkah and they <span class=\"gray\">(the Companions)</span> accompanied him until they came to the valley of Kharrar from Al-Juhfah. They stopped there and Sahl took a bath. He <span class=\"gray\">(Sahl)</span> was a white man, with a handsome body and nice skin. So the brother of Bani 'Adi bin Ka'b, 'Amir bin Rabi'ah looked at Sahl while he bathed and he said, \"I haven't seen the skin of a beautiful virgin girl nicer than this that I see today.\" Then Sahl suddenly had a seizure and fell to the ground. So he <span class=\"gray\">(Sahl)</span> was brought to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and it was said to him, \"O Messenger of Allah! Can you do anything for Sahl? By Allah, he has not lifted his head nor has he regained consciousness.\" The Prophet ﷺ then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَلْ تَتَّهِمُونَ فِيهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do you all blame <span class=\"gray\">(or hold responsible)</span> anyone for what has happened to him?)</span> They said, \"'Amir bin Rabi'ah looked at him.\" So the Prophet ﷺ called 'Amir and he was very angry with him. He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَلَامَ يَقْتُلُ أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ، هَلَّا إِذَا رَأَيْتَ مَا يُعْجِبُكَ بَرَّكْتَ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Would one of you knowingly kill his brother? Why don't you ask Allah to bless your brother when you see something <span class=\"gray\">(of him)</span> that you like?)</span> Then the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"af qpc-hafs\" lang=\"af\">اغْتَسِلْ لَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Bathe for him.)</span> So he <span class=\"gray\">('Amir)</span> washed his face, his hands, his elbows, his knees, his feet and the inside of his Izar <span class=\"gray\">(waist wrapper)</span> in a drinking vessel. Then that water was poured over him <span class=\"gray\">(Sahl)</span>. A man poured it over Sahl's head and his back from behind him, then the container was turned upside down and emptied behind him. This was done, and afterwards Sahl recovered and left with the people having nothing wrong with him.\"</p><p lang=\"so\" class=\"so \">The Hadith of 'Amir bin Rabi'ah</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad that 'Ubaydullah bin 'Amir said, \"'Amir bin Rabi'ah and Sahl bin Hanayf went off together intending to bathe. So they went about their business using coverings <span class=\"gray\">(to cover their nakedness)</span>. So 'Amir removed a cloak of wool that he <span class=\"gray\">(Sahl)</span> was using to conceal himself. He <span class=\"gray\">('Amir)</span> said, 'I looked at him and my eye fell upon him while he was pouring water on himself bathing. Then I heard a loud splash in the water coming from where he was. So I went to him, and I called him three times, but he did not answer me. So I went to the Prophet ﷺ and informed him. Then, the Prophet ﷺ came walking, and he was wading in the water. I can still picture the whiteness of his shins. When he came to Sahl <span class=\"gray\">(who was unconscious)</span>, he hit him on his chest with his hand and said,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">اللّٰهُمَّ اصْرِفْ عَنْهُ حَرَّهَا وَبَرْدَهَا وَوَصَبَهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Allah! Remove from him its heat, its cold and its pain.)</span> He <span class=\"gray\">(Sahl)</span> then stood up, and Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا رَأَى أَحَدُكُمْ مِنْ أَخِيهِ، أَوْ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ، أَوْ مِنْ مَالِهِ مَا يُعْجِبُهُ، فَلْيُبَرِّكْ فَإِنَّ الْعَيْنَ حَقٌّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If one of you sees in his brother, or himself, or his wealth that which pleases him, then he should ask Allah to bless it, for verily, the evil eye is real.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Accusation of the Disbelievers and the Reply to Them</p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَقُولُونَ إِنَّهُ لَمَجْنُونٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and they say: \"Verily, he is a madman!\")</span> meaning, they cut at him with their eyes and attack him with their tongues saying, \"Verily, he is a madman.\" They say this because he came with the Qur'an. Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا هُوَ إِلَّا ذِكْرٌ لِلْعَالَمِينَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But it is nothing else but a Reminder to all the creatures <span class=\"gray\">('Alamin)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the end of the explanation <span class=\"gray\">(Tafsir)</span> of Surah Nun <span class=\"gray\">(or Al-Qalam)</span>, and all praise and blessing belong to Allah.</p>"
