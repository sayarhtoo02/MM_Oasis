    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Or like a rainstorm in the sky, bringing darkness, thunder, and lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap for fear of death. But Allah ever encompasses the disbelievers <span>(19)</span>The lightning almost snatches away their sight, whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein, and when darkness covers them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Certainly, Allah has power over all things <span>(20)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Another Parable of the Hypocrites</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is another parable which Allah gave about the hypocrites who sometimes know the truth and doubt it at other times. When they suffer from doubt, confusion and disbelief, their hearts are,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">كَصَيِّبٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Like a Sayyib)</span>, meaning, \"The rain\", as Ibn Mas'ud, Ibn 'Abbas, and several other Companions have confirmed as well as Abu Al-'Aliyah, Mujahid, Sa'id bin Jubayr, 'Ata', Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, 'Atiyah Al-'Awfi, 'Ata' Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi' bin Anas. Ad-Dahhak said \"It is the clouds.\" However, the most accepted opinion is that it means the rain that comes down during,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ظُلُمَاتٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(darkness)</span>, meaning, here, the doubts, disbelief and hypocrisy.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَرَعْدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(thunder)</span> that shocks the hearts with fear. The hypocrites are usually full of fear and anxiety, just as Allah described them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَحْسَبُونَ كُلَّ صَيْحَةٍ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They think that every cry is against them)</span><span class=\"gray\">(63: 4)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَحْلِفُونَ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّهُمْ لَمِنكُمْ وَمَا هُم مِّنكُمْ وَلَٰكِنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ يَفْرَقُونَ - لَوْ يَجِدُونَ مَلْجَأً أَوْ مَغَارَاتٍ أَوْ مُدَّخَلًا لَّوَلَّوْا إِلَيْهِ وَهُمْ يَجْمَحُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They swear by Allah that they are truly of you while they are not of you, but they are a people who are afraid. Should they find refuge, or caves, or a place of concealment, they would turn straightway thereto in a swift rush)</span><span class=\"gray\">(9:56-57)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْبَرْقُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The lightning)</span>, is in reference to the light of faith that is sometimes felt in the hearts of the hypocrites,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَجْعَلُونَ أَصَابِعَهُمْ فِي آذَانِهِم مِّنَ الصَّوَاعِقِ حَذَرَ الْمَوْتِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ مُحِيطٌ بِالْكَافِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They thrust their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap for fear of death. But Allah ever encompasses the disbelievers)</span>, meaning, their cautiousness does not benefit them because they are bound by Allah's all-encompassing will and decision. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ الْجُنُودِ - فِرْعَوْنَ وَثَمُودَ - بَلِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فِي تَكْذِيبٍ - وَاللَّهُ مِن وَرَائِهِم مُّحِيطٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Has the story reached you of two hosts. Of Fir'awn <span class=\"gray\">(Pharaoh)</span> and Thamud Nay! The disbelievers <span class=\"gray\">(persisted)</span> in denying. And Allah encompasses them from behind!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(85:17-20)</span>.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَكَادُ الْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَارَهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The lightning almost snatches away their sight)</span> meaning, because the lightning is strong itself, and because their comprehension is weak and does not allow them to embrace the faith. Also, 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas commented on the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَكَادُ الْبَرْقُ يَخْطَفُ أَبْصَارَهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The lightning almost snatches away their sight)</span>, \"The Qur'an mentioned almost all of the secrets of the hypocrites.\" 'Ali bin Abi Talhah also narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلَّمَآ أَضَآءَ لَهُم مَّشَوْاْ فِيهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein)</span>, \"Whenever the hypocrites acquire a share in the victories of Islam, they are content with this share. Whenever Islam suffers a calamity, they are ready to revert to disbelief.\". Similarly, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ عَلَى حَرْفٍ فَإِنْ أَصَابَهُ خَيْرٌ اطْمَأَنَّ بِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And among mankind is he who worships Allah on the edge: If good befalls him, he is content with that.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(22:11)</span>. Also, Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn 'Abbas said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلَّمَآ أَضَآءَ لَهُم مَّشَوْاْ فِيهِ وَإِذَآ أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُواْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein, and when darkness covers them, they stand still)</span>,</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">They recognize the truth and speak about it. So their speech is upright, but when they revert to disbeleif, they again fall into confusion. This was also said by Abu Al-'Aliyah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi' bin Anas and As-Suddi, who narrated it from the Companions, and it is the most obvious and most correct view, and Allah knows best.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Consequently, on the Day of Judgment, the believers will be given a light according to the degree of their faith. Some of them will gain light that illuminates over a distance of several miles, some more, some less. Some people's light will glow sometimes and be extinguished at other times. They will, therefore, walk on the Sirat <span class=\"gray\">(the bridge over the Fire)</span> in the light, stopping when it is extinguished. Some people will have no light at all, these are the hypocrites whom Allah described when He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَقُولُ الْمُنَافِقُونَ وَالْمُنَافِقَاتُ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا انظُرُونَا نَقْتَبِسْ مِن نُّورِكُمْ قِيلَ ارْجِعُوا وَرَاءَكُمْ فَالْتَمِسُوا نُورًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day when the hypocrites ـ men and women ـ will say to the believers: \"Wait for us! Let us get something from your light!\" It will be said to them; \"Go back to you rear! Then seek a light!\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(57:13)</span>.</p><p lang=\"nl\" class=\"nl \">Allah described the believers,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ تَرَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ يَسْعَىٰ نُورُهُم بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَانِهِم بُشْرَاكُمُ الْيَوْمَ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day you shall see the believing men and the believing women ـ their light running forward before them and by their right hands. Glad tidings for you this Day! Gardens under which rivers flow <span class=\"gray\">(Paradise)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">(57:12)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ لَا يُخْزِي اللَّهُ النَّبِيَّ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَعَهُ نُورُهُمْ يَسْعَىٰ بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَانِهِمْ يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا أَتْمِمْ لَنَا نُورَنَا وَاغْفِرْ لَنَا إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Day that Allah will not disgrace the Prophet <span class=\"gray\">(Muhammad ﷺ)</span> and those who believe with him. Their Light will run forward before them and <span class=\"gray\">(with their Records ـ Books of deeds)</span> in their right hands. They will say: \"Our Lord! Keep perfect our Light for us <span class=\"gray\">[and do not put it off till we cross over the Sirat <span class=\"gray\">(a slippery bridge over the Hell)</span> safely]</span> and grant us forgiveness. Verily, You are Able to do all things\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(66:8)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud commented on,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نُورُهُمْ يَسْعَى بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Their Light will run forward before them)</span>, \"They will pass on the Sirat. according to their deeds. The light that some people have will be as big as a mountain, while the light of others will be as big as a date tree. The people who will have the least light are those whose index fingers will sometimes be lit and extinguished at other times.\" Ibn Abi Hatim also reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Every person among the people of Tawhid <span class=\"gray\">(Islamic Monotheism)</span> will gain a light on the Day of Resurrection. As for the hypocrite, his light will be extinguished. When the believers witness the hypocrite's light being extinguished, they will feel anxious. Hence, they will supplicate,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">رَبَّنَآ أَتْمِمْ لَنَا نُورَنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Our Lord! Keep perfect our Light for us)</span>.\" Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, everyone who has embraced the faith will be given a light. When they arrive at the Sirat, the light of the hypocrites will be extinguished. When the believers see this, they will feel anxious and supplicate,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">رَبَّنَآ أَتْمِمْ لَنَا نُورَنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Our Lord! Keep perfect our Light for us)</span>.\"</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Types of Believers and Types of Disbelievers</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Consequently, there are several types of people. There are the believers whom the first four Ayat <span class=\"gray\">(2:2-5)</span> in Surat Al-Baqarah describe. There are the disbelievers who were described in the next two Ayat. And there are two categories of hypocrites: the complete hypocrites who were mentioned in the parable of the fire, and the hesitant hypocrites, whose light of faith is sometimes lit and sometimes extinguished. The parable of the rain was revealed about this category, which is not as evil as the first category.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is similar to the parables that were given in Surat An-Nur <span class=\"gray\">(chapter 24)</span>. Like the example of the believer and the faith that Allah put in his heart, compared to a brightly illuminated lamp, just like a rising star. This is the believer, whose heart is built on faith and receiving its support from the divine legislation that was revealed to it, without any impurities or imperfections, as we will come to know, Allah willing.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah gave a parable of the disbelievers who think that they have something, while in reality they have nothing; such people are those who have compounded ignorance. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَعْمَالُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ يَحْسَبُهُ الظَّمْآنُ مَاءً حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءَهُ لَمْ يَجِدْهُ شَيْئًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, until he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing)</span><span class=\"gray\">(24:39)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah then gave the example of ignorant disbelievers, simple in their ignorance. He said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوْ كَظُلُمَاتٍ فِي بَحْرٍ لُّجِّيٍّ يَغْشَاهُ مَوْجٌ مِّن فَوْقِهِ مَوْجٌ مِّن فَوْقِهِ سَحَابٌ ظُلُمَاتٌ بَعْضُهَا فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ إِذَا أَخْرَجَ يَدَهُ لَمْ يَكَدْ يَرَاهَا وَمَن لَّمْ يَجْعَلِ اللَّهُ لَهُ نُورًا فَمَا لَهُ مِن نُّورٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or <span class=\"gray\">(the state of a disbeliever)</span> is like the darkness in a vast deep sea, overwhelmed by waves, topped by dark clouds, <span class=\"gray\">(layers of)</span> darkness upon darkness: if a man stretches out his hand, he can hardly see it! And he for whom Allah has not appointed light, for him there is no light)</span><span class=\"gray\">(24:40)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, Allah divided the camp of the disbelievers into two groups, advocates and followers. Allah mentioned these two groups in the beginning of Surat Al-Hajj,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَادِلُ فِي اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَيَتَّبِعُ كُلَّ شَيْطَانٍ مَّرِيدٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And among mankind is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge, and follows every rebellious <span class=\"gray\">(disobedient to Allah)</span> Shaytan <span class=\"gray\">(devil)</span><span class=\"gray\">(devoid of every kind of good)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">(22:3)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُجَادِلُ فِي اللَّهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ وَلَا هُدًى وَلَا كِتَابٍ مُّنِيرٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And among men is he who disputes about Allah, without knowledge or guidance, or a Book giving light <span class=\"gray\">(from Allah)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">(22:8)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Furthermore, Allah has divided the group of the believers in the beginning of Surat Al-Waqi'ah <span class=\"gray\">(56)</span> and at the end. He also divided them in Surat Al-Insan <span class=\"gray\">(76)</span> into two groups, the Sabiqun <span class=\"gray\">(those who preceded)</span>, they are the \"near ones\" <span class=\"gray\">(Muqaribun)</span> and Ashab Al-Yamin <span class=\"gray\">(the companions of the right)</span>, and they are righteous <span class=\"gray\">(Abrar)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In summary, these Ayat divide the believers into two categories, the near ones and righteous. Also, the disbelievers are of two types, advocates and followers. In addition, the hypocrites are divided into two types, pure hypocrites and those who have some hypocrisy in them. The Two Sahihs record that 'Abdullah bin 'Amr said that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثَلَاثٌ مَنْ كُنَّ فِيهِ كَانَ مُنَافِقًا خَالِصًا، وَمَنْ كَانَتْ فِيهِ وَاحِدَةٌ مِنْهُنَّ كَانَتْ فِيهِ خَصْلَةٌ مِنَ النِّفَاقِ حَتَّى يَدَعَهَا: مَنْ إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإِذَا وَعَدَ أَخْلَفَ، وَإِذَا ائْتُمِنَ خَانَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever has the following three <span class=\"gray\">(characteristics)</span> will be a pure hypocrite, and whoever has one of the following three characteristics will have one characteristic of hypocrisy, unless and until he gives it up. Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie. Whenever he makes a covenant, he proves treacherous. Whenever he is entrusted, he breaches the trust)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Hence, man might have both a part of faith and a part of hypocrisy, whether in deed, as this Hadith stipulates, or in the creed, as the Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:20)</span> stipulates.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Types of Hearts</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Imam Ahmad recorded Abu Sa'id saying that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْقُلُوبُ أَرْبَعَةٌ: قَلْبٌ أَجْرَدُ فِيهِ مِثْلُ السِّرَاجِ يَزْهَرُ وَقَلْبٌ أَغْلَفُ مَرْبُوطٌ عَلى غِلَافِهِ وَقَلْبٌ مَنْكُوسٌ وَقَلْبٌ مُصْفَحٌ، فَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْأَجْرَدُ فَقَلْبُ الْمُؤْمِنِ فَسِرَاجُهُ فِيهِ نُورُهُ، وَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْأَغْلَفُ فَقَلْبُ الْكَافِرِ، وَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْمَنْكُوسُ فَقَلْبُ الْمُنَافِقِ الْخَالِصِ عَرَفَ ثُمَّ أَنْكَرَ وَأَمَّا الْقَلْبُ الْمُصْفَحُ فَقَلْبٌ فِيهِ إيمَانٌ وَنِفَاقٌ وَمَثَلُ الْإيمَانِ فِيهِ كَمَثَلِ الْبَقْلَةِ يَمُدُّهَا الْمَاءُ الطَّيِّبُ وَمَثَلُ النِّفَاقِ فِيهِ كَمَثَلِ الْقُرْحَةِ يَمُدُّهَا الْقَيْحُ وَالدَّمُ فَأَيُّ الْمَادَّتَيْنِ غَلَبَتْ عَلَى الْأُخْرَى غَلَبَتْ عَلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The hearts are four <span class=\"gray\">(types)</span>: polished as shiny as the radiating lamp, a sealed heart with a knot tied around its seal, a heart that is turned upside down and a wrapped heart. As for the polished heart, it is the heart of the believer and the lamp is the light of faith. The sealed heart is the heart of the disbeliever. The heart that is turned upside down is the heart of the pure hypocrite, because he had knowledge but denied it. As for the wrapped heart, it is a heart that contains belief and hypocrisy. The example of faith in this heart, is the example of the herb that is sustained by pure water. The example of hypocrisy in it, is the example of an ulcer that thrives on puss and blood. Whichever of the two substances has the upper hand, it will have the upper hand on that heart)</span>. This Hadith has a Jayid Hasan <span class=\"gray\">(good)</span> chain of narration.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَارِهِمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if Allah willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight. Certainly, Allah has power over all things)</span>. Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn 'Abbas commented on Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\"> وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَذَهَبَ بِسَمْعِهِمْ وَأَبْصَارِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if Allah willed, He would have taken away their hearing and their sight)</span>, \"Because they abandoned the truth after they had knowledge in it.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Certainly, Allah has power over all things)</span>. Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Allah is able to punish or pardon His servants as He wills.\" Ibn Jarir commented, \"Allah only described Himself with the ability to do everything in this Ayah as a warning to the hypocrites of His control over everything, and to inform them that His ability completely encompasses them and that He is able to take away their hearing and sight.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Jarir and several other scholars of Tafsir stated that these two parables are about the same kind of hypocrite. So the 'or' mentioned in,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or like a rainstorm from the sky)</span> means 'and', just as the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلاَ تُطِعْ مِنْهُمْ ءَاثِماً أَوْ كَفُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And obey neither a sinner or a disbeliever among them)</span>. Therefore, 'or' in the Ayah includes a choice of using either example for the hypocrites. Also, Al-Qurtubi said that 'or' means, \"To show compatibility of the two choices, just as when one says, 'Sit with Al-Hasan or Ibn Sirin.' According to the view of Az-Zamakhshari, 'so it means each of these persons is the same as the other, so you may sit with either one of them.' The meaning of 'or' thus becomes 'either.' Allah gave these two examples of the hypocrites, because they both perfectly describe them.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">I <span class=\"gray\">(Ibn Kathir)</span> say, these descriptions are related to the type of hypocrite, because there is a difference between them as we stated. For instance, Allah mentioned these types in Surat Bara'ah <span class=\"gray\">(chapter 9)</span> when He repeated the statement, \"And among them\" three times, describing their types, characteristics, statements and deeds. So the two examples mentioned here describe two types of hypocrites whose characteristics are similar. For instance, Allah gave two examples in Surat An-Nur, one for the advocates of disbelief and one for the followers of disbelief, He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَعْمَالُهُمْ كَسَرَابٍ بِقِيعَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(As for those who disbelieved, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert)</span><span class=\"gray\">(24:39)</span>, until,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوْ كَظُلُمَاتٍ فِي بَحْرٍ لُّجِّيٍّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or <span class=\"gray\">(the state of a disbeliever)</span> is like the darkness in a vast deep sea)</span><span class=\"gray\">(24:40)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The first example is of the advocates of disbelief who have complex ignorance, while the second is about the followers who have simple ignorance. Allah knows best.</p>"
