Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. <span>(53)</span>\"And turn in repentance <span class=\"gray\">(and in obedience with true faith)</span> to your Lord and submit to Him before the torment comes upon you, <span class=\"gray\">(and)</span> then you will not be helped. <span>(54)</span>\"And follow the best of that which is sent down to you from your Lord, before the torment comes on you suddenly while you perceive not! <span>(55)</span>Lest a person should say: \"Alas, my grief that I was undutiful to Allah, and I was indeed among those who mocked. <span>(56)</span>Or <span class=\"gray\">(lest)</span> he should say: \"If only Allah had guided me, I should indeed have been among those who have Taqwa. <span>(57)</span>Or <span class=\"gray\">(lest)</span> he should say when he sees the torment: \"If only I had another chance, then I should indeed be among the doers of good. <span>(58)</span>Yes! Verily, there came to you My Ayat and you denied them, and were proud and were among the disbelievers <span>(59)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Call to repent before the Punishment comes</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Ayah is a call to all sinners, be they disbelievers or others, to repent and turn to Allah. This Ayah tells us that Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will forgive all the sins of those who repent to Him and turn back to Him, no matter what or how many his sins are, even if they are like the foam of the sea. This cannot be interpreted as meaning that sins will be forgiven without repentance, because Shirk can only be forgiven for the one who repents from it. Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said that some of the people of Shirk killed many people and committed Zina <span class=\"gray\">(illegal sexual acts)</span> to a great extent; they came to Muhammad ﷺ and said, \"What you are saying and calling us to is good; if only you could tell us that there is an expiation for what we have done.\" Then the following Ayat were revealed:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ لَا يَدْعُونَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا آخَرَ وَلَا يَقْتُلُونَ النَّفْسَ الَّتِي حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ وَلَا يَزْنُونَ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse)</span><span class=\"gray\">(25:68)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِهِمْ لَا تَقْنَطُوا مِنْ رَحْمَةِ اللَّهِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"O My servants who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of the mercy of Allah.)</span> This was also recorded by Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i. What is meant by the first Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(25:68)</span> is:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِلَّا مَنْ تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Except those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds)</span><span class=\"gray\">(25:70)</span>. Imam Ahmad recorded that Asma' bint Yazid, said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ reciting,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">إِنَّهُ عَمَلٌ غَيْرُ صَالِحٍ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(verily, his work is unrighteous)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11:46)</span>. And I heard him ﷺ say:  </p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ يَا عِبَادِي الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِهِمْ لَا تَقْنَطُوا مِنْ رَحْمَةِ اللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًا ۚ وَ لَا يُبَالِي إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"O My servants who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of the mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins He does not reckon him Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful)</span>.\" This was also recorded by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">All of these Hadiths indicate that what is meant is that Allah forgives all sins provided that a person repents. Additionally, one must not despair of the mercy of Allah even if his sins are many and great, for the door of repentance and mercy is expansive. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ يَقْبَلُ التَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His servants)</span><span class=\"gray\">(9:104)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ يَعْمَلْ سُوءًا أَوْ يَظْلِمْ نَفْسَهُ ثُمَّ يَسْتَغْفِرِ اللَّهَ يَجِدِ اللَّهَ غَفُورًا رَحِيمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah's forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:110)</span>. Concerning the hypocrites, Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ فِي الدَّرْكِ الْأَسْفَلِ مِنَ النَّارِ وَلَنْ تَجِدَ لَهُمْ نَصِيرًا - إِلَّا الَّذِينَ تَابُوا وَأَصْلَحُوا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth <span class=\"gray\">(grade)</span> of the Fire; no helper will you find for them. Except those who repent, and do righteous good deeds)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:145-146)</span>. And Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ ثَالِثُ ثَلَاثَةٍ ۘ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ إِلَّا إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۚ وَإِنْ لَمْ يَنْتَهُوا عَمَّا يَقُولُونَ لَيَمَسَّنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely, disbelievers are those who said: \"Allah is the third of the three <span class=\"gray\">(in a Trinity)</span>.\" But there is no god but One. And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(5:73)</span>. Then He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَلَا يَتُوبُونَ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَهُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Will they not turn in repentance to Allah and ask His forgiveness? For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(5:74)</span> And Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَتَنُواْ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَـتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَتُوبُواْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, those who put into trial the believing men and believing women <span class=\"gray\">(by torturing them)</span>, and then do not turn in repentance <span class=\"gray\">(to Allah)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">(85: 10)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Hasan Al-Basri, may Allah have mercy on him, said, \"Look at this generosity and kindness! They killed His close friends but He still called them to repentance and forgiveness.\" There are many Ayat on this topic.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Two Sahihs record the Hadith of Abu Sa'id, may Allah be pleased with him, from Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the man who killed ninety-nine people. Later on, he regretted it and asked a worshipper among the Children of Israel whether he could repent. He told him no, so he killed him, thus completing one hundred. Then he asked one of their scholars whether he could repent. He said, \"What is stopping you from repenting?\" Then he told him to go to a town where Allah was worshipped. He set out for that town, but death came to him while he was on the road. The angels of mercy and the angels of punishment disputed over him, so Allah commanded them to measure the distance between the two towns; whichever he was closer to was the one to which he belonged. They found that he was closer to the town he was heading for, so the angels of mercy took him. It was said that when he was dying, he moved himself <span class=\"gray\">(towards that town)</span>, and Allah commanded the good town to move closer to him and the other town to move away. This is basic meaning of the Hadith; we have quoted it in full elsewhere.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِهِمْ لَا تَقْنَطُوا مِنْ رَحْمَةِ اللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًا ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"O My servants who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of the mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins...\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah invites all to His forgiveness; those who claim that the Messiah is God, those who claim that the Messiah is the son of God, those who claim that 'Uzayr is the son of God, those who claim that Allah is poor, those who claim that the Hand of Allah is tied up, and those who say that Allah is the third of three <span class=\"gray\">[Trinity]</span>. Allah says to all of these:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَلَا يَتُوبُونَ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَهُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Will they not turn in repentance to Allah and ask His forgiveness? For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(5:74)</span>. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And He calls to repentance the one who says something even worse than that, the one who says, 'I am your Lord most high,' and says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> مَا عَلِمْتُ لَكُمْ مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"I know not that you have a god other than me.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(28:38)</span>. Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Anyone who makes the servants of Allah despair of His mercy after this, has rejected the Book of Allah, but a person cannot repent until Allah decrees that he should repent.\" </p><p lang=\"ha\" class=\"ha \">At-Tabarani recorded that Shutayr bin Shakal said, \"I heard Ibn Mas'ud say, 'The greatest Ayah in the Book of Allah is:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:255)</span>. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The most comprehensive Ayah in the Qur'an concerning good and evil is:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالْإِحْسَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah enjoins justice and Al-Ihsan)</span><span class=\"gray\">(16:90)</span>. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Ayah in the Qur'an which brings the most relief is in Surat Az-Zumar:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِهِمْ لَا تَقْنَطُوا مِنْ رَحْمَةِ اللَّهِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"O My servants who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of the mercy of Allah.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And the clearest Ayah in the Qur'an about reliance on Allah is:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَلْ لَهُ مَخْرَجًا - وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لَا يَحْتَسِبُ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out <span class=\"gray\">(from every difficulty)</span>. And He will provide him from <span class=\"gray\">(sources)</span> he never could imagine)</span><span class=\"gray\">(65:2-3)</span>.' Masruq said to him; 'You have spoken the truth.'\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Hadiths which tell us not to despair</p><p lang=\"cy\" class=\"cy \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, say:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ! لَوْ أَخْطَأْتُمْ حتّٰى تَمْلَأَ خَطَايَاكُمْ مَا بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، ثُمَّ اسْتَغْفَرْتُمُ اللهَ تَعَالَىٰ لَغَفَرَ لَكُمْ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسُ مُحَمَّدٍ بِيَدِهِ! لَوْ لَمْ تُخْطِئُوا لَجَاءَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ بِقَوْمٍ يُخْطِئُونَ، ثُمَّ يَسْتَغْفِرُونَ اللهَ فَيَغْفِرُ لَهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if you were to commit sin until your sins filled the space between heaven and earth, then you were to ask Allah for forgiveness, He would forgive you. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, if you did not commit sin, Allah would bring other people who would commit sins and then ask Allah for forgiveness so that He could forgive them.)</span>\" This was recorded only by Ahmad. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari, may Allah be pleased with him, said, as he was on his deathbed, \"I have concealed something from you that I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ; he said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَوْلَا أَنَّكُمْ تُذْنِبُونَ لَخَلَقَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ قَوْمًا يُذْنِبُونَ، فَيَغْفِرُ لَهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If you did not commit sins, Allah would create people who would sin so that He could forgive them.)</span>\" This was recorded by Imam Ahmad; it was also recorded by Muslim in his Sahih, and by At-Tirmidhi. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah encourages His servants to hasten to repent, as He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنِيبُوا إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَسْلِمُوا لَهُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And turn in repentance <span class=\"gray\">(and in obedience with true faith)</span> to your Lord and submit to Him)</span> meaning, turn back to Allah and submit yourselves to Him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يَأْتِيَكُمُ الْعَذَابُ ثُمَّ لَا تُنْصَرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(before the torment comes upon you, <span class=\"gray\">(and)</span> then you will not be helped.)</span> means, hasten to repent and do righteous deeds before His wrath comes upon you.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاتَّبِعُوا أَحْسَنَ مَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And follow the best of that which is sent down to you from your Lord,)</span> means, the Qur'an.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يَأْتِيَكُمُ الْعَذَابُ بَغْتَةً وَأَنْتُمْ لَا تَشْعُرُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(before the torment comes on you suddenly while you perceive not!)</span> means, without you realizing it.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنْ تَقُولَ نَفْسٌ يَا حَسْرَتَا عَلَىٰ مَا فَرَّطْتُ فِي جَنْبِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Lest a person should say: \"Alas, my grief that I was undutiful to Allah...\")</span> means, on the Day of Resurrection, the sinner who neglected to repent and turn back to Allah will regret it, and will wish that he had been one of the righteous who obeyed Allah.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنْ كُنْتُ لَمِنَ السَّاخِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and I was indeed among those who mocked.)</span> means, 'my actions in this world were those of one who ridicules and makes fun, not of one who has firm faith and is sincere.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوْ تَقُولَ لَوْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ هَدَانِي لَكُنْتُ مِنَ الْمُتَّقِينَ - أَوْ تَقُولَ حِينَ تَرَى الْعَذَابَ لَوْ أَنَّ لِي كَرَّةً فَأَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or <span class=\"gray\">(lest)</span> he should say: \"If only Allah had guided me, I should indeed have been among those who have Taqwa \". Or he should say when he sees the torment: \"If only I had another chance, then I should indeed be among the doers of good.\")</span> means, he will wish that he could go back to this world, so that he could do righteous deeds. 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Allah tells us what His servants will say before they say it and what they will do before they do it. He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا يُنَبِّئُكَ مِثْلُ خَبِيرٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And none can inform you like Him Who is the All-Knower)</span><span class=\"gray\">(35:14)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنْ تَقُولَ نَفْسٌ يَا حَسْرَتَا عَلَىٰ مَا فَرَّطْتُ فِي جَنْبِ اللَّهِ وَإِنْ كُنْتُ لَمِنَ السَّاخِرِينَ - أَوْ تَقُولَ لَوْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ هَدَانِي لَكُنْتُ مِنَ الْمُتَّقِينَ - أَوْ تَقُولَ حِينَ تَرَى الْعَذَابَ لَوْ أَنَّ لِي كَرَّةً فَأَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Lest a person should say: \"Alas, my grief that I was undutiful to Allah, and I was indeed among those who mocked.\" Or he should say: \"If only Allah had guided me, I should indeed have been among those who have Taqwa.\" Or he should say when he sees the torment: \"If only I had another chance, then I should indeed be among the doers of good.\")</span>. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُّ أَهْلِ النَّارِ يَرَىٰ مَقْعَدَهُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ فَيَقُولُ: لَوْ أَنَّ اللهَ هَدَانِي! فَتَكُونُ عَلَيْهِ حَسْرَةً، قال: وَكُلُّ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ يَرَىٰ مَقْعَدَهُ مِنَ النَّارِ فَيَقُولُ: لَوْلَا أَنَّ اللهَ هَدَانِي، قال: فَيَكُونُ لَهُ شُكْرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Each of the people of Hell will be shown his place in Paradise and he will say, \"If only Allah had guided me!\" so it will be a source of regret for him. And each of the people of Paradise will be shown his place in Hell and he will say, \"If it were not for the fact that Allah guided me,\" so it will be a cause of thanks.)</span>\" It was also narrated by An-Nasa'i. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When the sinners wish that they could return to this world so that they could believe the Ayat of Allah and follow His Messengers, Allah will say:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَلَىٰ قَدْ جَاءَتْكَ آيَاتِي فَكَذَّبْتَ بِهَا وَاسْتَكْبَرْتَ وَكُنْتَ مِنَ الْكَافِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yes! Verily, there came to you My Ayat and you denied them, and were proud and were among the disbelievers.)</span> meaning, 'O you who regret what you did, My Ayat did come to you in the world, and My proof was established against you, but you rejected it and were too arrogant to follow it, and you were among those who disbelieved in it.'</p>"
