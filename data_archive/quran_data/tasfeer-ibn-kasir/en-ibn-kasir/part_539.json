    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And if they deny you, so were Messengers denied before you. And to Allah return all matters <span>(4)</span>O mankind! Verily, the promise of Allah is true. So, let not this present life deceive you, and let not the chief deceiver deceive you about Allah <span>(5)</span>Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take <span class=\"gray\">(treat)</span> him as an enemy. He only invites his followers that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire <span>(6)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Consolation in the fact that the previous Messengers were denied, and a reminder of the Resurrection</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah says: 'Even if these idolators who associate others with Allah disbelieve in you, O Muhammad, and go against the Message of Tawhid that you have brought, you have an example in the Messengers who came before you.' They also brought a clear Message to their people and told them to worship Allah alone, but their people denied them and went against them.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الْأُمُورُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And to Allah return all matters <span class=\"gray\">(for decision)</span>.)</span> means, 'We will requite them for that in full.' Then Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O mankind! Verily, the promise of Allah is true.)</span> meaning the Resurrection will undoubtedy come to pass.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا تَغُرَّنَّكُمُ الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So, let not this present life deceive you,)</span> means, 'this life is as nothing in compare to the great good that Allah has promised to His close friends and the followers of His Messengers, so do not let these transient attractions distract you from that which is lasting.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا يَغُرَّنَّكُمْ بِاللَّهِ الْغَرُورُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and let not the chief deceiver deceive you about Allah.)</span> This refers to Shaytan, as stated by Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Meaning, do not let the Shaytan tempt you and divert you away from following the Messengers of Allah and believing what they say, for he is the chief deceiver and arch-liar. This Ayah is like the Ayah that appears at the end of Surah Luqman:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا تَغُرَّنَّكُمُ الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَا يَغُرَّنَّكُمْ بِاللَّهِ الْغَرُورُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(let not then this <span class=\"gray\">(worldly)</span> present life deceive you, nor let the chief deceiver deceive you about Allah)</span><span class=\"gray\">(31:33)</span>. Then Allah tells us of the enmity of Iblis towards the sons of Adam:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ فَاتَّخِذُوهُ عَدُوًّا ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take <span class=\"gray\">(treat)</span> him as an enemy.)</span> meaning, 'he has declared his enmity towards you, so be even more hostile towards him, oppose him and do not believe the things with which he tries to tempt you.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّمَا يَدْعُو حِزْبَهُ لِيَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ السَّعِيرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He only invites his followers that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire.)</span> means, 'he only wants to misguide you so that you will enter the blazing Fire with him.' This is a manifest enemy, and we ask Allah, the All-Powerful and Almighty to make us enemies of Shaytan and to make us followers of the Book of Allah and of the way of His Messengers. For He is able to do whatever He wills and He will respond to all supplication. This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذْ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ اسْجُدُوا لِآدَمَ فَسَجَدُوا إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ كَانَ مِنَ الْجِنِّ فَفَسَقَ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهِ ۗ أَفَتَتَّخِذُونَهُ وَذُرِّيَّتَهُ أَوْلِيَاءَ مِنْ دُونِي وَهُمْ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ ۚ بِئْسَ لِلظَّالِمِينَ بَدَلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And <span class=\"gray\">(remember)</span> when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves unto Adam.\" So they prostrated themselves except Iblis. He was one of the Jinn; he disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you then take him <span class=\"gray\">(Iblis)</span> and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you What an evil is the exchange for the wrongdoers.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(18:50)</span></p>"

He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ أَنْ تَزُولَا ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah grasps the heavens and the earth lest they should move away from their places,)</span> means, lest they should shift from where they are. This is like the Ayat:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيُمْسِكُ السَّمَاءَ أَنْ تَقَعَ عَلَى الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth except by His leave)</span><span class=\"gray\">(22:65)</span>, and</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَنْ تَقُومَ السَّمَاءُ وَالْأَرْضُ بِأَمْرِهِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And among His signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by His command)</span><span class=\"gray\">(30:25)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَئِنْ زَالَتَا إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and if they were to move away from their places, there is not one that could grasp them after Him.)</span> means, no one can make them stay and preserve them except Him. He is Ever Most Forbearing and Oft-Forgiving because He sees His servants disbelieving in Him and disobeying Him, yet He is patient and gives them time, He waits and does not hasten the punishment, and He conceals the faults of others and forgives them. He says:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">إِنَّهُ كَانَ حَلِيمًا غَفُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Truly, He is Ever Most Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.)</span></p>"

This was the view of Ad-Dahhak and others. This is like the Ayat:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنْ تَقُولُوا إِنَّمَا أُنْزِلَ الْكِتَابُ عَلَىٰ طَائِفَتَيْنِ مِنْ قَبْلِنَا وَإِنْ كُنَّا عَنْ دِرَاسَتِهِمْ لَغَافِلِينَ - أَوْ تَقُولُوا لَوْ أَنَّا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنَا الْكِتَابُ لَكُنَّا أَهْدَىٰ مِنْهُمْ ۚ فَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ ۚ فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ كَذَّبَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَصَدَفَ عَنْهَا ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Lest you <span class=\"gray\">(pagan Arabs)</span> should say: \"The Book was sent down only to two sects before us, and for our part, we were in fact unaware of what they studied.\" Or lest you should say: \"If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have been better guided than they.\" So, now has come unto you a clear proof from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy. Who then does more wrong than one who rejects the Ayat of Allah and turns away therefrom?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:156-157)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنْ كَانُوا لَيَقُولُونَ - لَوْ أَنَّ عِنْدَنَا ذِكْرًا مِنَ الْأَوَّلِينَ - لَكُنَّا عِبَادَ اللَّهِ الْمُخْلَصِينَ - فَكَفَرُوا بِهِ ۖ فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And indeed they <span class=\"gray\">(Arab pagans)</span> used to say: \"If we had a reminder as had the men of old, We would have indeed been the chosen servants of Allah!\" But they disbelieve therein, so they will come to know!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(37:167-170)</span> Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(yet when a warner came to them,)</span> – meaning, Muhammad ﷺ with the Book revealed to him, i.e., the Clear Qur'an,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا زَادَهُمْ إِلَّا نُفُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(it increased in them nothing but flight <span class=\"gray\">(from the truth)</span>.)</span> means, they only increased in their disbelief.
