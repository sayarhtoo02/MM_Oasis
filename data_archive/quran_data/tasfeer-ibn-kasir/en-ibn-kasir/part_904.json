Al-Haqqah!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2. What is Al-Haqqah?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(3. And what will make you know what Al-Haqqah is?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4. Thamud and 'Ad denied the Qari'ah!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(5. As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the Taghiyah!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6. And as for 'Ad, they were destroyed by a wind, Sarsar 'Atiyah!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7. Which Allah imposed on them for seven nights and eight days Husum, so that you could see men lying toppled, as if they were trunks of date palms, Khawiyah!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(8. Do you see any remnants of them?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(9. And Fir'awn, and those before him, and the cities overthrown committed Al-Khati'ah.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(10. And they disobeyed their Lord's Messenger, so He seized them with a punishment that was Rabiyah.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11. Verily, when the water rose beyond its limits, We carried you in the ship.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(12. That We might make it an admonition for you and that it might be retained by the retaining ears.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Warning concerning the Greatness of the Day of Judgement</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Haqqah is one of the names of the Day of Judgement, because during it the promise and the threat will inevitably occur. Due to this, Allah has declared the greatness of this matter. So He says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا الْحَاقَّةُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And what will make you know what Al-Haqqah is?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Mention of the Destruction of the Nations</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah mentions the destruction of the nations that denied the Resurrection. He says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَأُهْلِكُوا بِالطَّاغِيَةِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the Taghiyah!)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It is the cry which will silence them, and the quake that will silence them. Qatadah said similar to this when he said, \"At-Taghiyah is the shout.\" Mujahid said, \"At-Taghiyah means the sins.\" This was also said by Ar-Rabi' bin Anas and bin Zayd. They said that it means transgression. After mentioning this, Ibn Zayd recited the following Ayat as proof for his statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ بِطَغْوَاهَا</p><p lang=\"cy\" class=\"cy \"><span class=\"gray\">(Thamud denied through their transgression.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(91:11)</span> Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَأُهْلِكُوا بِرِيحٍ صَرْصَرٍ</p><p lang=\"cy\" class=\"cy \"><span class=\"gray\">(And as for 'Ad, they were destroyed by a wind Sarsar)</span> meaning, a cold wind. Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi' bin Anas and Ath-Thawri all said about,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَاتِيَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">('Atiyah)</span> \"This means severe blowing of the wind.\" Qatadah said, \"It blew fiercely upon them until it pierced their hearts.\" Ad-Dahhak said,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">صَرْصَرٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Sarsar)</span> \"This means cold, and</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَاتِيَةٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">('Atiyah)</span> means, it blew fiercely upon them without any mercy or blessing.\" 'Ali and others said, \"It blew fiercely upon their stored harvest until it was brought out worthless.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَخَّرَهَا عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Which Allah imposed on them)</span> meaning, He made it overpower them.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَبْعَ لَيَالٍ وَثَمَانِيَةَ أَيَّامٍ حُسُومًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(for seven nights and eight days Husum,)</span> Husum means, complete, successive and unfortunately evil. Ibn Mas'ud, Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, 'Ikrimah, Ath-Thawri and others all said, \"Husum means in succession.\" It has been reported that 'Ikrimah and Ar-Rabi' bin Khuthaym both said, \"It means it was unfortunately evil upon them.\" This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِي أَيَّامٍ نَحِسَاتٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(in days of calamity)</span><span class=\"gray\">(41: 16)</span> It has been said that it is that which people now call A'jaz <span class=\"gray\">(apparently used to mean evil devastation)</span>. It seems as though the people took this term from Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَتَرَى الْقَوْمَ فِيهَا صَرْعَىٰ كَأَنَّهُمْ أَعْجَازُ نَخْلٍ خَاوِيَةٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so that you could see the people lying toppled, as if they were A'jaz <span class=\"gray\">(trunks)</span> of date palms, Khawiyah!)</span> Ibn 'Abbas said about,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خَاوِيَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Khawiyah)</span> \"It means ruined.\" Others besides him said, \"It means dilapidated.\" This means that the wind would cause one of them <span class=\"gray\">(palm tree)</span> to hit the ground, and it will fall down dead on his head. Then his head would shatter and it would remain a lifeless corpse as if it were without branches, motionless. It has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نُصِرْتُ بِالصَّبَا وَأُهْلِكَتْ عَادٌ بِالدَّبُورِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I was helped by an easterly wind and the people of 'Ad were destroyed by a westerly wind.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَهَلْ تَرَىٰ لَهُمْ مِنْ بَاقِيَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do you see any remnants of them?)</span> meaning, 'do you find any one of them left or anyone who even attributes himself to being from them?' Rather they are all gone, right down to the last of them, and Allah did not make for them any successors. Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَاءَ فِرْعَوْنُ وَمَنْ قَبْلَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Fir'awn and those before him committed <span class=\"gray\">(sin)</span>)</span> This has been recited with a Kasrah under the letter Qaf <span class=\"gray\">(in the word Qabalahu, as Qiblahu)</span>, which changes the meaning to those who were with him in his time, and they were his followers who were disbelieving Coptic people. Others recited it with a Fathah over the letter Qaf <span class=\"gray\">(as the word Qablahu)</span>, which means those nations before him who were similar to him. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْمُؤْتَفِكَاتُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(the overthrown cities)</span> those nations that rejected their Messengers.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِالْخَاطِئَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(committed Al-Khati'ah.)</span> Al-Khati'ah means their rejection of what Allah revealed. Ar-Rabi' said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِالْخَاطِئَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(committed Al-Khati'ah.)</span> \"This means disobedience.\" Mujahid said, \"They committed errors.\" Thus, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَعَصَوْا رَسُولَ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they disobeyed their Lord's Messenger,)</span> meaning they were all of the same type, they all denied the Messenger of Allah who was sent to them. As Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلٌّ كَذَّبَ الرُّسُلَ فَحَقَّ وَعِيدِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Everyone of them denied the Messengers, so My threat took effect.)</span> So whoever denies a Messenger, then verily, he denies all of the Messengers. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَذَّبَتْ قَوْمُ نُوحٍ الْمُرْسَلِينَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The people of Nuh belied the Messengers)</span><span class=\"gray\">(26:105)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَذَّبَتْ عَادٌ الْمُرْسَلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">('Ad belied the Messengers.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(26:123)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Thamud belied the Messengers.)</span> However, only one Messenger came to every nation. Thus, Allah says here,<span class=\"gray\">(26:141)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَعَصَوْا رَسُولَ رَبِّهِمْ فَأَخَذَهُمْ أَخْذَةً رَابِيَةً </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they disobeyed their Lord's Messenger, so He seized them with a punishment that was Rabiyah.)</span> Rabiyah means, great, severe and painful. Mujahid said, \"Rabiyah means severe.\" As-Suddi said, \"It means destructive.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">A Reminder about the Blessing of the Ship</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَى الْمَاءُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, when the water rose beyond its limits,)</span> meaning, it rose up over its shores by the leave of Allah and it overcame all that existed. Ibn 'Abbas and others said, \"The water rising beyond its boundary means it increased abundantly.\" This happened due to the supplication of Nuh against his people when they denied him, opposed him and worshipped other than Allah. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, Allah answered his supplication and the people of the earth were covered with the flood except for those who were with Nuh in the ship. Thus, are humans all from the loins of Nuh and his progeny. For this reason Allah reminds humanity of His blessing,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّا لَمَّا طَغَى الْمَاءُ حَمَلْنَاكُمْ فِي الْجَارِيَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, when the water rose beyond its limits, We carried you in the ship.)</span> meaning, a ship running along upon the surface of the water.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِنَجْعَلَهَا لَكُمْ تَذْكِرَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That We might make it an admonition for you)</span> The pronoun \"it\" here refers to the species of the object <span class=\"gray\">(ships)</span> due to the general meaning alluding to this. Thus, the meaning is, 'We caused its type of creation <span class=\"gray\">(ships)</span> to remain <span class=\"gray\">(in the earth)</span> for you, so that you ride upon the currents of the water in the seas. ' This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِنَ الْفُلْكِ وَالْأَنْعَامِ مَا تَرْكَبُونَ - لِتَسْتَوُوا عَلَىٰ ظُهُورِهِ ثُمَّ تَذْكُرُوا نِعْمَةَ رَبِّكُمْ إِذَا اسْتَوَيْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and has appointed for you ships and cattle on which you ride; In order that you may mount on their backs, and then may remember the favor of your Lord when you mount thereon)</span><span class=\"gray\">(43:12-13)</span> And Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَآيَةٌ لَّهُمْ أَنَّا حَمَلْنَا ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ فِي الْفُلْكِ الْمَشْحُونِ - وَخَلَقْنَا لَهُم مِّن مِّثْلِهِ مَا يَرْكَبُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And an Ayah for them is that We bore their offspring in the laden ship. And We have created for them of the like thereunto, on which they ride.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(36:41,42)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Qatadah said, \"Allah caused this ship to remain until the first people of this Ummah saw it.\" However, the first view <span class=\"gray\">(that it refers to all ships in general)</span> is the most apparent. Allah continues saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَعِيَهَا أُذُنٌ وَاعِيَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and that it might be retained by the retaining ears.)</span> meaning, that a receptive ear may understand and reflect upon this bounty. Ibn 'Abbas said, \"This means an ear that is retentive and hearing.\" Qatadah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> أُذُنٌ وَاعِيَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(by the retaining ears.)</span> means, \"An ear that Allah gives intelligence, so it benefits by what it hears from Allah's Book.\" Ad-Dahhak said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَعِيَهَا أُذُنٌ وَاعِيَةٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and that it might be retained by the retaining ears.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(69:12)</span> means, \"An ear that hears it and retains it, meaning the person who has sound hearing, and correct intellect.\" And this is general concerning everyone who understands and retains.</p>"
