When Allah intended to create the creation, He knew what their work will be before they existed. He wrote all this in a Book, kept with Him, fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth. Muslim recorded that 'Abdullah bin 'Amr narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ قَدَّرَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلْقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah decided the destination and due measurement of the creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth, and His Throne was over the water.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There are many Hadiths on this subject, and certainly, the matter of Al-Qadar is of utmost importance, yet this is not where we should discuss it. </p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ لَّا يَفْقَهُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ أَعْيُنٌ لَّا يُبْصِرُونَ بِهَا وَلَهُمْ آذَانٌ لَّا يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They have hearts wherewith they understand not, and they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not.)</span> meaning, they do not benefit from these senses that Allah made for them as a means of gaining guidance. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُمْ سَمْعًا وَأَبْصَارًا وَأَفْئِدَةً فَمَا أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُمْ سَمْعُهُمْ وَلَا أَبْصَارُهُمْ وَلَا أَفْئِدَتُهُم مِّن شَيْءٍ إِذْ كَانُوا يَجْحَدُونَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We had assigned them the <span class=\"gray\">(faculties of)</span> hearing, seeing, and hearts; but their hearing, seeing, and their hearts availed them nothing since they used to deny the Ayat.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[46:26]</span>. Allah also said about the hypocrites,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَرْجِعُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(They are)</span> deaf, dumb, and blind, so they return not <span class=\"gray\">(to the right path)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:18]</span>, and about the disbelievers,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْيٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(They are)</span> deaf, dumb and blind. So they do not understand.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:171]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">However, they are not deaf, dumb or blind, except relation to the guidance. Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ عَلِمَ اللَّهُ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا لَّأَسْمَعَهُمْ وَلَوْ أَسْمَعَهُمْ لَتَوَلَّوا وَّهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Had Allah known of any good in them, He would indeed have made them listen; and even if He had made them listen, they would but have turned away with aversion <span class=\"gray\">(to the truth)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[8:23]</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِنَّهَا لَا تَعْمَى الْأَبْصَارُ وَلَٰكِن تَعْمَى الْقُلُوبُ الَّتِي فِي الصُّدُورِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[22:46]</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن يَعْشُ عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَانًا فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ - وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whosoever turns away blindly from the remembrance of the Most Gracious <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span>, We appoint for him Shaytan to be an intimate companion to him. And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright!)</span><span class=\"gray\">[43:36-37]</span> Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُولَٰئِكَ كَالْأَنْعَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They are like cattle)</span>, means, those who neither hear the truth, nor understand it, nor see the guidance, are just like grazing cattle that do not benefit from these senses, except for what sustains their life in this world. Allah said in a similar Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا كَمَثَلِ الَّذِي يَنْعِقُ بِمَا لَا يَسْمَعُ إِلَّا دُعَاءً وَنِدَاءً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the example of those who disbelieve is as that of one who shouts to those who hear nothing but calls and cries.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:171]</span> meaning, their example, when they are called to the faith, is the example of cattle that hear only the voice of their shepherd, but cannot understand what he is saying. Allah further described them</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(nay even more astray)</span>, than cattle, because cattle still respond to the call of their shepherd, even though they do not understand what he is saying. As for the people described here, they are unlike cattle, which fulfill the purpose and service they were created for. The disbeliever was created to worship Allah alone in Tawhid, but he disbelieved in Allah and associated others in His worship. Therefore, those people who obey Allah are more honorable than some angels, while cattle are better than those who disbelieve in Him. So Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُولَٰئِكَ كَالْأَنْعَامِ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْغَافِلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones.)</span></p>"
