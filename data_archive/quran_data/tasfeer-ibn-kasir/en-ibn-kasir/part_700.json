    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Verily, those who disbelieve, and hinder from the path of Allah, and oppose the Messenger, after the guidance has been clearly shown to them, they will not harm Allah in the least, but He will make their deeds fruitless <span>(32)</span>O you who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger and invalidate not your deeds <span>(33)</span>Verily, those who disbelieved and obstructed others from the path of Allah and then died as disbelievers – never will Allah not forgive them <span>(34)</span>So do not lose heart and beg for peace while you are superior. Allah is with you and He will never deprive you of <span class=\"gray\">(the reward of)</span> your deeds <span>(35)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Nullifying the Disbelievers' Deeds and the Command to chase Them</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah then informs about those who disbelieve, obstruct others from the path of Allah, oppose the Messenger ﷺ and contend with him, and revert from the faith after guidance has become clear to them. He indicates that those people can never harm Allah in the least, and rather they only harm themselves and become losers on the Day of Resurrection. He will nullify their deeds. Allah will not reward them even the weight of a mosquito <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., the smallest thing)</span> for any good that they did before their apostasy, but would instead totally invalidate and destroy it. Their apostasy wipes away their good deeds entirely, just as the good deeds would normally wipe away the evil deeds. Imam Ahmad Ibn Nasr Al-Marwazi reported in Kitab As-Salah <span class=\"gray\">(the Book of Prayer)</span> that Abu Al-'Aliyah said, \"The Prophet's Companions used to think that no sin would harm a person who says 'La ilaha illallah,' just as no good deed would benefit a person who joins partners with Allah. So Allah revealed,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَلَا تُبْطِلُوا أَعْمَالَكُمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and do not invalidate your deeds.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This made them fear that some sins could nullify their deeds.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It has also been reported from Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said, \"We, the Companions of Allah's Messenger ﷺ, used to think that good deeds would all be accepted, until Allah revealed,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَلَا تُبْطِلُوا أَعْمَالَكُمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and do not invalidate your deeds.)</span> So we asked each other: 'What is it that can nullify our deeds?' So we said, 'The major sins, great offenses that require admission into the Fire and immoral sins.' But then Allah revealed,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَنْ يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah does not forgive joining partners with Him in worship, but He forgives except that to whom He wills.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:48)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">After this was revealed, we ceased saying that. We thereafter continued to fear for those who committed great sins and immoral sins and to have hope for those who did not.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then, Allah commands His believing servants to obey Him and His Messenger ﷺ, which would result in their happiness in this worldly life and the Hereafter. He also prohibits them from apostasy, because that would result in the nullification of their deeds. Thus He says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تُبْطِلُوا أَعْمَالَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and do not invalidate your deeds.)</span> meaning, by apostasy. Thus, Allah says after this,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَصَدُّوا عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ مَاتُوا وَهُمْ كُفَّارٌ فَلَنْ يَغْفِرَ اللَّهُ لَهُمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, those who disbelieved and obstructed others from the path of Allah and then died as disbelievers – never will Allah forgive them.)</span> This is similar to His saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَنْ يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ يَشَاءُ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah does not forgive joining partners with Him in worship, but He forgives except that to whom He wills.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:48)</span> Allah then addresses His believing servants by saying,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">فَلَا تَهِنُوا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So do not lose heart)</span> meaning, do not be weak concerning the enemies.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَدْعُوا إِلَى السَّلْمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and beg for peace)</span> meaning, compromise, peace, and ending the fighting between you and the disbelievers while you are in a position of power, both in great numbers and preparations. Thus, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا تَهِنُوا وَتَدْعُوا إِلَى السَّلْمِ وَأَنْتُمُ الْأَعْلَوْنَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So do not lose heart and beg for peace while you are superior.)</span> meaning, in the condition of your superiority over your enemy. If, on the other hand, the disbelievers are considered more powerful and numerous than the Muslims, then the Imam <span class=\"gray\">(general commander)</span> may decide to hold a treaty if he judges that it entails a benefit for the Muslims. This is like what Allah's Messenger ﷺ did when the disbelievers obstructed him from entering Makkah and offered him treaty in which all fighting would stop between them for ten years. Consequently, he ﷺ agreed to that. Allah then says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ مَعَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah is with you)</span> This contains the good news of victory and triumph over the enemies.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَنْ يَتِرَكُمْ أَعْمَالَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and He will never deprive you of <span class=\"gray\">(the reward of)</span> your deeds.)</span> meaning, Allah will never invalidate your deeds, nullify them, or deprive you of them, but rather He will give you your rewards complete, without any reduction.\" And Allah knows best.</p>"

Because of this, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنْ تُؤْمِنُوا وَتَتَّقُوا يُؤْتِكُمْ أُجُورَكُمْ وَلَا يَسْأَلْكُمْ أَمْوَالَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if you believe and have Taqwa of Allah, He will grant you your rewards, and will not ask from you <span class=\"gray\">(to sacrifice all of)</span> your possessions.)</span> meaning, He is in no need of you, and asks you for nothing. He only ordained giving charity from your wealth so that you would help your needy brothers. The benefit of that would then come back to you, as well as the rewards. Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنْ يَسْأَلْكُمُوهَا فَيُحْفِكُمْ تَبْخَلُوا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If He would demand of you all of it and urge you, you would withhold.)</span> meaning, if He pressures you much, you would become stingy.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيُخْرِجْ أَضْغَانَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He will expose your <span class=\"gray\">(secret)</span> ill–wills.)</span> Qatadah said, \"Allah knows that extracting wealth <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., money from people)</span> brings about ill-wills. \" Indeed, Qatadah has said the truth, because money is dear to the people, and they do not spend it except in things that are dearer to them than it. Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَا أَنْتُمْ هَٰؤُلَاءِ تُدْعَوْنَ لِتُنْفِقُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَمِنْكُمْ مَنْ يَبْخَلُ ۖ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Here you are now invited to spend in Allah's cause; but among you are those who withhold <span class=\"gray\">(stingily)</span>.)</span> meaning, they refuse to spend. Allah continues,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ يَبْخَلْ فَإِنَّمَا يَبْخَلُ عَن نَّفْسِهِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whoever acts stingily is but stingy toward himself.)</span> meaning, he only reduces his own rewards, and the bad outcome of that will come back to him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ الْغَنِيُّ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(For Allah is indeed Al-Ghani)</span> Allah is in need of nothing else, whereas everything is ever in need of Him.

The description of Allah as Al-Ghani <span class=\"gray\">(in no need)</span> is a necessary description of Allah; on the other hand, the description of the creation as Faqr <span class=\"gray\">(needy)</span> is a necessary description for them that they cannot avoid. Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنْ تَتَوَلَّوْا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if you turn away,)</span> which means, if you turn away from obeying Him and adhering to His Laws.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَسْتَبْدِلْ قَوْمًا غَيْرَكُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَكُونُوا أَمْثَالَكُم </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He will replace you with other people; then they will not be like you.)</span> meaning, rather, they will be people who will listen to Him and obey His commands.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This concludes the Tafsir of Surat Al-Qital.
