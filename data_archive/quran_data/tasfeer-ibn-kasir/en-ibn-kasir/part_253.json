As Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن يَخْرُجْ مِن بَيْتِهِ مُهَاجِرًا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ثُمَّ يُدْرِكْهُ الْمَوْتُ فَقَدْ وَقَعَ أَجْرُهُ عَلَى اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whosoever leaves his home as an emigrant unto Allah and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, his reward is then surely incumbent upon Allah)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:100)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيَرْزُقَنَّهُمُ اللَّهُ رِزْقًا حَسَنًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(surely, Allah will provide a good provision for them.)</span> means, He will reward them from His bounty and provision in Paradise with that which will bring them joy.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَّازِقِينَ - لَيُدْخِلَنَّهُم مُّدْخَلًا يَرْضَوْنَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, it is Allah Who indeed is the Best of those who make provision. Truly, He will make them enter an entrance with which they shall be well-pleased,)</span> This means Paradise, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَمَّا إِن كَانَ مِنَ الْمُقَرَّبِينَ - فَرَوْحٌ وَرَيْحَانٌ وَجَنَّتُ نَعِيمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then, if he be of those brought near <span class=\"gray\">(to Allah)</span>, rest and provision, and a Garden of Delights.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(56:88-89)</span>. Allah tells us that He will grant him rest and provision and a Garden of Delights, as He tells us here:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيَرْزُقَنَّهُمُ اللَّهُ رِزْقًا حَسَنًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(surely, Allah will provide a good provision for them.)</span> Then He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيُدْخِلَنَّهُم مُّدْخَلًا يَرْضَوْنَهُ ۗ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَعَلِيمٌ حَلِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Truly, He will make them enter an entrance with which they shall be well-pleased, and verily, Allah indeed is All-Knowing,)</span> meaning, He is All-Knowing about those who migrate and strive in Jihad for His sake and who deserve that <span class=\"gray\">(reward)</span>.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">حَلِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Most Forbearing,)</span> means, He forgives and overlooks their sins, and He accepts as expiation for their sins, their migration <span class=\"gray\">(Hijrah)</span> and their putting their trust in Him.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Concerning those who are killed for the sake of Allah, whether they are Muhajirs <span class=\"gray\">(migrants)</span> or otherwise, they are alive with their Lord and are being provided for, as Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَحْسَبَنَّ الَّذِينَ قُتِلُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ أَمْوَاتًا ۚ بَلْ أَحْيَاءٌ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ يُرْزَقُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Think not of those as dead who are killed in the way of Allah. Nay, they are alive, with their Lord, and they have provision)</span><span class=\"gray\">[3:169]</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There are many Hadiths on this topic, as stated previously. With regard to those who die for the sake of Allah, whether they are emigrants or not. This Ayah and the Sahih Hadiths guarantee that they will be well provided for and that Allah will show them kindness. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Shurahbil bin As-Simt said: \"We spent a long time besieging a stronghold in the land of the Romans. Salman Al-Farisi, may Allah be pleased with him, passed by me and said, 'I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ مَاتَ مُرَابِطًا أَجْرَى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ الْأَجْرِ، وَأَجْرَى عَلَيْهِ الرِّزْقَ، وَأَمِنَ مِنَ الفَتَّانِينَ، وَاقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ قُتِلُوا أَوْ مَاتُوا لَيَرْزُقَنَّهُمُ اللَّهُ رِزْقًا حَسَنًا ۚ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَّازِقِينَ - لَيُدْخِلَنَّهُم مُّدْخَلًا يَرْضَوْنَهُ ۗ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَعَلِيمٌ حَلِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever dies guarding the borders of Islam, Allah will give him a reward like that reward <span class=\"gray\">(of martyr)</span> and will provide for him and keep him safe from trials. Recite, if you wish: <span class=\"gray\">(Those who emigrated in the cause of Allah and after that were killed or died, surely, Allah will provide a good provision for them. And verily, it is Allah Who indeed is the Best of those who make provision. Truly, He will make them enter an entrance with which they shall be well-pleased, and verily, Allah indeed is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing)</span>)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He also recorded that 'Abdur-Rahman bin Jahdam Al-Khawlani was with Fadalah bin 'Ubayd when they accompanied with two funerals, at <span class=\"gray\">(an island of)</span> sea one of whom had been struck by a catapult, and the other had passed away. Fadalah bin 'Ubayd sat by the grave of the man who had passed away and someone said to him, \"Are you neglecting the martyr and not sitting by his grave?\" He said, \"I would not mind which of these two graves Allah would resurrect me from, for Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ قُتِلُوا أَوْ مَاتُوا لَيَرْزُقَنَّهُمُ اللَّهُ رِزْقًا حَسَنًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who emigrated in the cause of Allah and after that were killed or died, surely, Allah will provide a good provision for them.)</span>\" And he recited these two Ayat, then said, \"What should I seek, O you servant, if I were to enter an entrance to His pleasure, and be provided good provisions? By Allah, I would not mind which of these two graves Allah would resurrect me from.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَٰلِكَ وَمَنْ عَاقَبَ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبَ بِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That is so. And whoever has retaliated with the like of that which he was made to suffer....)</span> Muqatil bin Hayan and Ibn Jurayj mentioned that this was revealed about a skirmish in which the Companions encountered some of the idolators. The Muslims urged them not to fight during the Sacred Months, but the idolators insisted on fighting and initiated the aggression. So the Muslims fought them and Allah granted them victory.</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah indeed is Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.)</span></p>"

And verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer <span>(61)</span>That is because Allah – He is the Truth, and what they invoke besides Him, it is false. And verily, Allah – He is the Most High, the Most Great <span>(62)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Creator and Controller of this World is Allah</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah tells us that He is the Creator Who directs the affairs of His creation as He wills. He tells us:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلِ اللَّهُمَّ مَالِكَ الْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِي الْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَاءُ وَتَنزِعُ الْمُلْكَ مِمَّن تَشَاءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَاءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَاءُ ۖ بِيَدِكَ الْخَيْرُ ۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ - تُولِجُ اللَّيْلَ فِي النَّهَارِ وَتُولِجُ النَّهَارَ فِي اللَّيْلِ ۖ وَتُخْرِجُ الْحَيَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَتُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَيِّ ۖ وَتَرْزُقُ مَن تَشَاءُ بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"O Allah! Possessor of the power, You give power to whom You will, and You take power from whom You will, and You endue with honor whom You will, and You humiliate whom You will. In Your Hand is the good. Verily, You are able to do all things. You make the night to enter into the day, and You make the day to enter into the night, You bring the living out of the dead, and You bring the dead out of the living. And You give wealth and sustenance to whom You will, without limit.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(3:26-27)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The meaning of \"merging\" the night into the day and the day into the night is that the one encroaches upon the other, and vice versa. Sometimes the night is long and the day is short, as in winter, and sometimes the day is long and the night is short, as in summer.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer.)</span> He hears what His servants say, and He sees them, nothing about them or their movement is hidden from Him whatsoever. When Allah tells us that He is controlling the affairs of all that exists, and that He judges, and there is none to reverse His judgement, He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That is because Allah – He is the Truth,)</span> meaning, the true God, besides Whom no one deserves worship. He is the Possessor of the greatest sovereignty; whatever He wills happens and whatever He does not will does not happen. Everything is in need of Him and submits to Him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنَّ مَا يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ هُوَ الْبَاطِلُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and what they invoke besides Him, it is false.)</span> meaning, the idols and false gods. Everything that is worshipped instead of Him – may He be exalted – is false, because it can neither bring benefit nor cause harm.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, Allah – He is the Most High, the Most Great.)</span> This is like the Ayat:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and He is the Most High, the Most Great)</span><span class=\"gray\">(42:4)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْكَبِيرُ الْمُتَعَالِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(the Most Great, the Most High)</span><span class=\"gray\">[13:9]</span>. Everything is subject to His might and power; there is no God except Him and no Lord besides Him, because He is the Almighty and there is none mightier than He, the Most High and there is none higher than He, the Most Great and there is none greater than He. Exalted, sanctified, and glorified be He far above all that the evildoers say.</p>"
