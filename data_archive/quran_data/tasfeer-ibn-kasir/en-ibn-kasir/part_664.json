    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And among His signs are the ships in the sea like mountains <span>(32)</span>If He wills, He causes the wind to cease, then they would become motionless on the surface <span class=\"gray\">(of the sea)</span>. Verily, in this are signs for everyone patient and grateful <span>(33)</span>Or He may destroy them because of that which their <span class=\"gray\">(people)</span> have earned. And He pardons much <span>(34)</span>And those who dispute as regards Our Ayat may know that there is no place of refuge for them <span>(35)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ships are also among the Signs of Allah</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah tells us that another sign of His great power and dominion is the fact that He has subjugated the sea so that ships may sail in it by His command, so they sail in the sea like mountains. This was the view of Mujahid, Al-Hasan, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak. In other words, these ships on the sea are like mountains on land.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">إِنْ يَشَأْ يُسْكِنِ الرِّيحَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If He wills, He causes the wind to cease,)</span> means, the winds that cause the ships to travel on the sea. If He willed, He could cause the winds to cease, then the ships would not move and would remain still, neither coming nor going, staying where they are on the surface of the water.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَاتٍ لِكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, in this are signs for everyone patient)</span> means, who is patient in the face of adversity</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">شَكُورٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and grateful.)</span> means, in the fact that Allah has subjugated the sea and He sends as much wind as they need in order to travel, there are signs of His blessings to His creation for everyone who is patient, i.e., at times of difficulty, and grateful, i.e., at times of ease.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوْ يُوبِقْهُنَّ بِمَا كَسَبُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or He may destroy them because of that which their <span class=\"gray\">(people)</span> have earned.)</span> means, if He wills, He may destroy the ships and drown them, because of the sins of the people on board.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَعْفُ عَنْ كَثِيرٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He pardons much.)</span> means, of their sins; if He were to punish them for all of their sins, He would destroy everyone who sails on the sea. Some of the scholars interpreted the Ayah</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوْ يُوبِقْهُنَّ بِمَا كَسَبُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or He may destroy them because of that which their <span class=\"gray\">(people)</span> have earned.)</span> as meaning, if He willed, He could send the wind to blow fiercely so that it would take the ships and divert them from their courses, driving them to the right or the left, so that they would be lost and would not be able to follow their intended path. This interpretation also includes the idea of their being destroyed. This also fits the first meaning, which is that if Allah willed, He could cause the wind to cease, in which case the ships would stop moving, or He could make the wind fierce, in which case the ships would be lost and destroyed. But by His grace and mercy, He sends the wind according to their needs, just as He sends rain that is sufficient. If He sent too much rain, it would destroy their houses, and if He sent too little, their crops and fruits would not grow. In the case of lands such as Egypt, He sends water from another land, because they do not need rain; if rain were to fall upon them, it would destroy their houses and cause walls to collapse.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَعْلَمَ الَّذِينَ يُجَادِلُونَ فِي آيَاتِنَا مَا لَهُمْ مِنْ مَحِيصٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who dispute as regards Our Ayat may know that there is no place of refuge for them.)</span> means, they have no means of escape from Our torment and vengeance, for they are subdued by Our power.</p>"

    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So whatever you have been given is but <span class=\"gray\">(a passing)</span> enjoyment for this worldly life, but that which is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord <span>(36)</span>And those who shun the greater sins, and Al-Fawahish, and when they are angry, they forgive <span>(37)</span>And those who answer the Call of their Lord, and perform the Salah, and who <span class=\"gray\">(conduct)</span> their affairs by mutual consultation, and who spend of what We have bestowed on them <span>(38)</span>And those who, when an oppressive wrong is done to them, take revenge <span>(39)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Attributes of Those Who deserve that which is with Allah</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Here Allah points out the insignificance of this worldly life and its transient adornments and luxuries.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمَا أُوتِيتُمْ مِنْ شَيْءٍ فَمَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So whatever you have been given is but <span class=\"gray\">(a passing)</span> enjoyment for this worldly life.)</span> means, no matter what you achieve and amass, do not be deceived by it, for it is only the enjoyment of this life, which is the lower, transient realm that will undoubtedly come to an end.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا عِنْدَ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but that which is with Allah is better and more lasting)</span> means, the reward of Allah is better than this world, and it will last forever, so do not give preference to that which is transient over that which is lasting. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(for those who believe)</span> means, for those who are patient in forgoing the pleasures of this world,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and put their trust in their Lord.)</span> means, so that He will help them to be patient in doing what is obligatory and avoiding what is forbidden. Then Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ يَجْتَنِبُونَ كَبَائِرَ الْإِثْمِ وَالْفَوَاحِشَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who shun the greater sins, and Al-Fawahish,)</span> We have already discussed sin and Al-Fawahish in Surat Al-A'raf.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا مَا غَضِبُوا هُمْ يَغْفِرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and when they are angry, they forgive.)</span> means, their nature dictates that they should forgive people and be tolerant. Vengeance is not in their nature. It was reported in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ never took revenge for his own sake, only when the sacred Laws of Allah were violated.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ اسْتَجَابُوا لِرَبِّهِمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who answer the Call of their Lord,)</span> means, they follow His Messenger ﷺ and obey His commands and avoid that which He has prohibited.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَأَقَامُوا الصَّلَاةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and perform As-Salah)</span> – which is the greatest act of worship of Allah, may He be glorified.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَأَمْرُهُمْ شُورَىٰ بَيْنَهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and who <span class=\"gray\">(conduct)</span> their affairs by mutual consultation,)</span> means, they do not make a decision without consulting one another on the matter so that they can help one another by sharing their ideas concerning issues such as wars and other matters. This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَشَاوِرْهُمْ فِي الْأَمْرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and consult them in the affairs)</span><span class=\"gray\">(3:159)</span>. The Prophet ﷺ used to consult with them concerning wars and other matters, so that they would feel confidant. When 'Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, was dying, after he had been stabbed, he entrusted the choice of the next Khalifah to six people who were to be consulted. They were 'Uthman, 'Ali, Talhah, Az-Zubayr, Sa'id and 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf, may Allah be pleased with them all. Then all of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, agreed to appoint 'Uthman as their leader.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنْفِقُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and who spend of what We have bestowed on them.)</span> this means kindly treating the creation of Allah, starting with those who are closest, then the next closest, and so on.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَهُمُ الْبَغْيُ هُمْ يَنْتَصِرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who, when an oppressive wrong is done to them, take revenge.)</span> ameans, they have the strength to take revenge on those who commit aggressive wrong and hostile acts against them. They are not incapable of doing so and they are not helpless; they are able to take revenge against those who transgress against them, even though when they have the power to take revenge, they prefer to forgive, as when Yusuf, peace be upon him, said to his brothers:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا تَثْرِيبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ ۖ يَغْفِرُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(No reproach on you this day; may Allah forgive you)</span><span class=\"gray\">(12: 92)</span>. even though he was in a position to take revenge on them for what they had done to him. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ forgave the eighty people who intended to do him harm during the year of Al-Hudaybiyah, camping by the mountain of At-Tan'im. When he overpowered them, he set them free, even though he was in a position to take revenge on them. He also forgave Ghawrath bin Al-Harith who wanted to kill him and unsheathed his sword while he was sleeping. The Prophet ﷺ woke up to find him pointing the sword at him. He reproached him angrily and the sword dropped. Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ picked up the sword and called his Companions He told them what had happened, and he forgave the man. There are many similar Hadiths and reports. And Allah knows best.</p>"
