If you have believed in Allah, then put your trust in Him if you are Muslims. <span>(84)</span>They said: \"In Allah we put our trust. Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the folk who are wrongdoers <span>(85)</span>\"And save us by Your mercy from the disbelieving folk. <span>(86)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Musa encouraged His People to put Their Trust in Allah</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah told us that Musa said to the Children of Israel:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا قَوْمِ إِن كُنتُمْ آمَنتُم بِاللَّهِ فَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلُوا إِن كُنتُم مُّسْلِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O my people! If you have believed in Allah, then put your trust in Him if you are Muslims.)</span> Allah is sufficient for those who put their trust in Him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَيْسَ اللَّهُ بِكَافٍ عَبْدَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Is not Allah sufficient for His servant?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(39:36)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(65:3)</span> Allah combines worship and reliance in many places. He said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَاعْبُدْهُ وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So worship Him and put your trust in Him.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11:123)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ هُوَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ آمَنَّا بِهِ وَعَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"He is the Most Gracious <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span>, in Him we believe, and in Him we put our trust..)</span><span class=\"gray\">(67:29)</span> and</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَّبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ فَاتَّخِذْهُ وَكِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(He alone is)</span> the Lord of the east and the west; none has the right to be worshipped but He. So take Him <span class=\"gray\">(alone)</span> as a protector.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(73:9)</span> And Allah commanded the believers to say many times in their Salah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(You <span class=\"gray\">(Alone)</span> we worship, and You <span class=\"gray\">(Alone)</span> we ask for help <span class=\"gray\">(for each and everything)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(1:5)</span> The Children of Israel complied with this command and said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَلَى اللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا رَبَّنَا لَا تَجْعَلْنَا فِتْنَةً لِّلْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In Allah we put our trust. Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the folk who are wrongdoers.)</span> This means don't give them victory over us so that they rule us. So they might not think that they have authority over us because they were following the truth and we were falsehood. This might be a deceiving trial for them. This meaning was reported from Abu Mijliz and Abu Ad-Duha, 'Abdur-Razzaq, in a narration from Mujahid, said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبَّنَا لَا تَجْعَلْنَا فِتْنَةً لِّلْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Our Lord!

We truly have believed in You and put our trust in You.</p>"

They continued to go astray and be haughty and arrogant. Musa said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبَّنَا إِنَّكَ آتَيْتَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَأَهُ زِينَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Our Lord!

That they may lead men astray from Your path.)</span> was read with the word \"Liyadillu\" and \"Liyudillu.\" The first is with a Fathah over the Ya, meaning that \"You have given them that while You know they would not believe in what You have sent me with to them. You did that so they would gradually be drawn away from the truth.\" As Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِّنَفْتِنَهُمْ فِيهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that We may test them thereby.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(20:131)</span> and <span class=\"gray\">(72:17)</span>. Others read the word with a Dammah over the Ya. <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. Liyudillu)</span> This makes the Ayah mean: You have given them that so whoever You willed from among Your creatures will be tried. Those whom You wish to misguide would think that You have given them that because You loved them and You cared about them.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبَّنَا اطْمِسْ عَلَىٰ أَمْوَالِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Our Lord!

He prayed against Fir'awn and his chiefs when he was certain that there was no good in them. Similarly, Nuh prayed and said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَّبِّ لَا تَذَرْ عَلَى الْأَرْضِ مِنَ الْكَافِرِينَ دَيَّارًا - إِنَّكَ إِن تَذَرْهُمْ يُضِلُّوا عِبَادَكَ وَلَا يَلِدُوا إِلَّا فَاجِرًا كَفَّارًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(My Lord! Leave not one of the disbelievers on the earth! If You leave them, they will mislead Your servants, and they will beget none but wicked disbelievers.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(71:26-27)</span> Harun said \"Amin\" to his brother's prayer. And Allah answered Musa's prayer. Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَدْ أُجِيبَت دَّعْوَتُكُمَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the invocation of you both is accepted.)</span> 'in destroying Fir'awn's people.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَدْ أُجِيبَت دَّعْوَتُكُمَا فَاسْتَقِيمَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily I have answered your prayers <span class=\"gray\">(both of you)</span>. So you both keep to the straight way)</span> So as I have answered your prayer, you should remain steadfast on My command.' Ibn Jurayj narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said about this Ayah: \"Be steadfast and follow My command.\"</p>"
