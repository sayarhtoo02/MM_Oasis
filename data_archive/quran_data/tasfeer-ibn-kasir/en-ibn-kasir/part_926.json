Similar was reported from Mujahid, As-Suddi, Qatadah and several others. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِن كُنَّا عَن دِرَاسَتِهِمْ لَغَافِلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"...and for our part, we were in fact unaware of what they studied.\")</span> meaning: 'we did not understand what they said because the revelation was not in our tongue. We, indeed, were busy and unaware of their message,' so they said. Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوْ تَقُولُوا لَوْ أَنَّا أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا الْكِتَابُ لَكُنَّا أَهْدَىٰ مِنْهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or lest you should say: \"If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely, have been better guided than they.\")</span> meaning: We also refuted this excuse, had you used it, lest you say, \"If a Book was revealed to us, just as they received a Book, we would have been better guided than they are.\" Allah also said.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَقْسَمُوا بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ لَئِن جَاءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ لَّيَكُونُنَّ أَهْدَىٰ مِنْ إِحْدَى الْأُمَمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they swore by Allah their most binding oath that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than any of the nations <span class=\"gray\">(before them)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[35:42]</span> Allah replied here,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَقَدْ جَاءَكُم بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So now has come unto you a clear proof from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah says, there has come to you from Allah a Glorious Qur'an revealed to Muhammad ﷺ, the Arab Prophet. In it is the explanation of the lawful and unlawful matters, guidance for the hearts and mercy from Allah to His servants who follow and implement it. Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن كَذَّبَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَصَدَفَ عَنْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who then does more wrong than one who rejects the Ayat of Allah and Sadafa away therefrom?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This refers to the one who neither benefited from what the Messenger ﷺ brought, nor followed what he was sent with by abandoning all other ways. Rather, he Sadafa from following the Ayat of Allah, meaning, he discouraged and hindered people from following it. This is the explanation of As-Suddi for Sadafa, while Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah said that Sadafa means, he turned away from it.</p>"
