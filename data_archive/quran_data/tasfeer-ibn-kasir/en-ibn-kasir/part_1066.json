    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It is not <span class=\"gray\">(fitting)</span> for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he has fought <span class=\"gray\">(his enemies thoroughly)</span> in the land. You desire the goods of this world, but Allah desires <span class=\"gray\">(for you)</span> the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise <span>(67)</span>Were it not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took <span>(68)</span>So enjoy what you have gotten of booty in war, lawful and good, and have Taqwa of Allah. Certainly, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful <span>(69)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said, \"The Prophet ﷺ asked the people for their opinion about the prisoners of war of Badr, saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ قَدْ أَمْكَنَكُمْ مِنْهُم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah has made you prevail above them.)</span> 'Umar bin Al-Khattab stood up and said, 'O Allah's Messenger! Cut off their necks,' but the Prophet ﷺ turned away from him. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ again asked,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَاأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّ اللهَ قَدْ أَمْكَنَكُمْ مِنْهُمْ وَإِنَّمَا هُمْ إِخْوَانُكُمْ بِالْأَمْسِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O people! Allah has made you prevail over them, and only yesterday, they were your brothers.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Umar again stood up and said, 'O Allah's Messenger! Cut off their necks.' The Prophet ﷺ ignored him and asked the same question again and he repeated the same answer. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq stood up and said, 'O Allah's Messenger! I think you should pardon them and set them free in return for ransom.' Thereupon the grief on the face of Allah's Messenger ﷺ vanished. He pardoned them and accepted ransom for their release. Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, revealed this verse,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّوْلَا كِتَابٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ سَبَقَ لَمَسَّكُمْ فِيمَا أَخَذْتُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Were it not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took)</span>.\"</p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said about Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّوْلَا كِتَابٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ سَبَقَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Were it not a previous ordainment from Allah...)</span>,</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"In the Preserved Book, that war spoils and prisoners of war will be made allowed for you,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَمَسَّكُمْ فِيمَا أَخَذْتُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(would have touched you for what you took)</span>, because of the captives.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(a severe torment.)</span> Allah, the Exalted said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَكُلُوا مِمَّا غَنِمْتُمْ حَلَالًا طَيِّبًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So enjoy what you have gotten of booty in war, lawful and good)</span>.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-'Awfi also reported this statement from Ibn 'Abbas. A similar statement was collected from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn Mas'ud, Sa'id bin Jubayr, 'Ata', Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah and Al-A'mash. They all stated that,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّوْلَا كِتَابٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ سَبَقَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Were it not a previous ordainment from Allah. .)</span> refers to allowing the spoils of war for this Ummah.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Supporting this view is what the Two Sahihs recorded that Jabir bin 'Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُعْطِيتُ خَمْسًا لَمْ يُعْطَهُنَّ أَحَدٌ مِنَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ قَبْلِي: نُصِرْتُ بِالرُّعْبِ مَسِيرَةَ شَهْرٍ، وَجُعِلَتْ لِيَ الْأَرْضُ مَسْجِدًا وَطَهُورًا، وَأُحِلَّتْ لِيَ الْغَنَائِمُ وَلَمْ تُحَلَّ لِأَحَدٍ قَبْلِي، وَأُعْطِيتُ الشَّفَاعَةَ، وَكَان النَّبِيُّ يُبْعَثُ إِلَى قَوْمِهِ، وَبُعِثْتُ إِلَى النَّاسِ عَامَّةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I have been given five things which were not given to any Prophet before me. <span class=\"gray\">(They are:)</span> Allah made me victorious by awe, <span class=\"gray\">(by His frightening my enemies)</span> for a distance of one month's journey. The earth has been made a place for praying and a purifyer for me. The booty has been made lawful for me, yet it = was not lawful for anyone else before me. I have been given the right of intercession <span class=\"gray\">(on the Day of Resurrection)</span>. Every Prophet used to be sent to his people only, but I have been sent to all mankind.)</span></p><p lang=\"jv\" class=\"jv \">Al-A'mash narrated that Abu Salih said that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَمْ تَحِلَّ الْغَنَائِمُ لِسُودِ الرُّؤُوسِ غَيْرَنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(War booty was never allowed for any among mankind except us.)</span></p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \"><span class=\"gray\">[Abu Hurayrah said;]</span> This is why Allah the Most High said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَكُلُوا مِمَّا غَنِمْتُمْ حَلَالًا طَيِّبًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So enjoy what you have gotten of booty in war, lawful and good.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Muslims then took the ransom for their captives. In his Sunan, Imam Abu Dawud recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ fixed four hundred <span class=\"gray\">(Dirhams)</span> in ransom from the people of Jahiliyyah in the aftermath of Badr. The majority of the scholars say that the matter of prisoners of war is up to the Imam. If he decides, he can have them killed, such as in the case of Bani Qurayzah. If he decides, he can accept a ransom for them, as in the case of the prisoners of Badr, or exchange them for Muslim prisoners. The Messenger ﷺ exchanged a woman and her daughter who were captured by Salamah bin Al-Akwa', for exchange of some Muslims who were captured by the idolators, or if he decides he can take the prisoner as a captives.</p>"
