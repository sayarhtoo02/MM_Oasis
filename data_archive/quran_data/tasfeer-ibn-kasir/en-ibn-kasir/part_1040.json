    "text": "<p lang=\"it\" class=\"it \">The Virtues of Surat At-Tariq</p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">An-Nasa'i recorded that Jabir said, \"Mu'adh lead the Maghrib prayer and he recited Al-Baqarah and An-Nisa'. So the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَتَّانٌ أَنْتَ يَا مُعَاذُ، مَا كَانَ يَكْفِيكَ أَنْ تَقْرَأَ بِالسَّمَاءِ وَالطَّارِقِ وَالشَّمْسِ وَضُحَاهَا وَنَحْوِهَا؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Are you putting the people to trial O Mu'adh? Was it not sufficient for you to recite As-Sama'i wat-Tariq, and Ash-Shamsi wa Duhaha, and something like them?)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالسَّمَاءِ وَالطَّارِقِ - وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا الطَّارِقُ - النَّجْمُ الثَّاقِبُ - إِن كُلُّ نَفْسٍ لَّمَّا عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ - فَلْيَنظُرِ الْإِنسَانُ مِمَّ خُلِقَ - خُلِقَ مِن مَّاءٍ دَافِقٍ - يَخْرُجُ مِن بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَائِبِ - إِنَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَجْعِهِ لَقَادِرٌ - يَوْمَ تُبْلَى السَّرَائِرُ - فَمَا لَهُ مِن قُوَّةٍ وَلَا نَاصِرٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(1. By the heaven, and At-Tariq;)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2. And what will make you to know what At-Tariq is?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(3. The star, Ath-Thaqib.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4. There is no human being but has a protector over him.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(5. So, let man see from what he is created!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6. He is created from a water gushing forth,)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7. Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(8. Verily, He is Able to bring him back!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(9. The Day when all the secrets will be examined.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(10. Then he will have no power, nor any helper.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Swearing by the Existence of Humanity surrounded by the Organized System of Allah</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah swears by the heaven and what He has placed in it of radiant stars. Thus, He says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالسَّمَاءِ وَالطَّارِقِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By the heaven, and At-Tariq;)</span> Then He says,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا الطَّارِقُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And what will make you to know what At-Tariq is?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then He explains it by His saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">النَّجْمُ الثَّاقِبُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The star of Ath-Thaqib.)</span> Qatadah and others have said, \"The star has been named Tariq because it is only seen at night and it is hidden during the day.\" His view is supported by what has been mentioned in the authentic Hadith that prohibits a man to come to his family Taruq. This means that he comes to them unexpectedly at nighttime.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الثَّاقِبُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Ath-Thaqib.)</span> Ibn 'Abbas said, \"The illuminating.\" 'Ikrimah said, \"It is illuminating and it burns the Shaytan\" Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِن كُلُّ نَفْسٍ لَّمَّا عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is no human being but has a protector over him.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, every soul has a guardian over it from Allah that protects it from the calamities. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">لَهُ مُعَقِّبَاتٌ مِّن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ يَحْفَظُونَهُ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(For Him, there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the command of Allah.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(13:11)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">How Man is Created is a Proof of Allah's Ability to Return Him to Him</p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">Allah says,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">فَلْيَنظُرِ الْإِنسَانُ مِمَّ خُلِقَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So, let man see from what he is created!)</span> This is alerting man to the weakness of his origin from which he was created. The intent of it is to guide man to accept <span class=\"gray\">(the reality of)</span> the Hereafter, because whoever is able to begin the creation then he is also able to repeat it in the same way. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(30:27)</span> Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خُلِقَ مِن مَّاءٍ دَافِقٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He is created from a water gushing forth.)</span> meaning, the sexual fluid that comes out bursting forth from the man and the woman. Thus, the child is produced from both of them by the permission of Allah. Due to this Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَخْرُجُ مِن بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَائِبِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, the backbone <span class=\"gray\">(or loins)</span> of the man and the ribs of the woman, which is referring to her chest. Shabib bin Bishr reported from 'Ikrimah who narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that he said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَخْرُجُ مِن بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَائِبِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"The backbone of the man and the ribs of the woman. It <span class=\"gray\">(the fluid)</span> is yellow and fine in texture. The child will not be born except from both of them <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., their sexual fluids)</span>.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">إِنَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَجْعِهِ لَقَادِرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, He is Able to bring him back <span class=\"gray\">(to life)</span>!)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This means that He is able to return this man that is created from fluid gushed forth. In other words, He is able to repeat his creation and resurrect him to the final abode. This is clearly possible, because whoever is able to begin the creation then he surely is able to repeat it. Indeed Allah has mentioned this proof in more than one place in the Qur'an.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">On the Day of Judgement, Man will have no Power or Assistance</p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">In this regard Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ تُبْلَى السَّرَائِرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Day when all the secrets will be examined.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, on the Day of Judgement the secrets will be tested. This means that they will be exposed and made manifest. Thus, the secret will be made open and that which is concealed will be well known. It is confirmed in the Two Sahihs on the authority of Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُرْفَعُ لِكُلِّ غَادِرٍ لِوَاءٌ عِنْدَ اسْتِهِ يُقَالُ: هٰذِهِ غَدْرَةُ فُلَانِ بْنِ فُلَانٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Every betrayer will have a flag raised for him behind his back, and it will be said, 'This is the betrayal of so-and-so, the son of so-and-so.')</span> Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">فَمَا لَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then he will have no)</span> meaning, man on the Day of Judgement.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مِن قُوَّةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(any power)</span> meaning, within himself.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا نَاصِرٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(nor any helper.)</span> meaning, from other than himself. This statement means that he will not be able to save himself from the torment of Allah, and nor will anyone else be able to save him.</p>"

Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلٌ فَصْلٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, this is the Word that separates.)</span></p><p lang=\"hmn\" class=\"hmn \">Ibn 'Abbas said <span class=\"gray\">(Fasl is)</span>, \"True.\" Qatadah also said the same.
