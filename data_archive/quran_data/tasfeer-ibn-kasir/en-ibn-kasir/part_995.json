    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write whom they find written of with them in the Tawrah and the Injil, – he commands them to do good; and forbids them from evil; he makes lawful for them the good things, and forbids them from the evil things, he releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters that were upon them. So those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful <span>(157)</span></p><div lang=\"fr\" class=\"fr \"><h2>The Description of that Messenger <span class=\"gray\">(ﷺ)</span></h2></div><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ الرَّسُولَ النَّبِيَّ الْأُمِّيَّ الَّذِي يَجِدُونَهُ مَكْتُوبًا عِندَهُمْ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ وَالْإِنجِيلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write whom they find written with them in the Tawrah and the Injil,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the description of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in the Books of the Prophets. They delivered the good news of his advent to their nations and commanded them to follow him. His descriptions were still apparent in their Books, as the rabbis and the priests well know. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sakhr Al-'Uqayli said that a bedouin man said to him, \"I brought a milk-producing camel to Al-Madinah during the life time of Allah's Messenger. After I sold it, I said to myself, 'I will meet that man <span class=\"gray\">(Muhammad)</span> and hear from him.' So I passed by him while he was walking between Abu Bakr and 'Umar, and I followed them until they went by a Jewish man, who was reading from an open copy of the Tawrah. He was mourning a son of his who was dying and who was one of the most handsome boys. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked him <span class=\"gray\">(the father)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنْشُدُكَ بِالَّذِي أَنْزَلَ التَّوْرَاةَ هَلْ تَجِدُ فِي كِتَابِكَ هَذَا صِفَتِي وَمَخْرَجِي؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I ask you by He Who has sent down the Tawrah, do you not find the description of me and my advent in your Book?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He nodded his head in the negative. His son said, 'Rather, yes, by He Who has sent down the Tawrah! We find the description of you and your advent in our Book. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that you are the Messenger of Allah.' The Prophet ﷺ said <span class=\"gray\">(to the Companions)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَقِيمُوا الْيَهُودِيَّ عَنْ أَخِيكُم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Stop the Jew <span class=\"gray\">(the father)</span> from <span class=\"gray\">(taking care of)</span> your brother <span class=\"gray\">(in Islam)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Prophet ﷺ then personally took care of the son's funeral and led the funeral prayer on him.'\" This Hadith is sound and is supported by a similar Hadith in the Sahih narrated from Anas. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Muthanna said that 'Ata' bin Yasar said, \"I met 'Abdullah bin 'Amr and asked him, 'Tell me about the description of Allah's Messenger ﷺ in the Tawrah.' He said, 'Yes, by Allah! He is described in the Tawrah, just as he is described in the Qur'an,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ إِنَّا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ شَاهِدًا وَمُبَشِّرًا وَنَذِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Prophet! Verily, We have sent you as a witness, and a bearer of glad tidings, and a warner.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[33:45]</span> as a safe refuge for the unlettered ones. 'You are My servant and Messenger. I have called you 'Al-Mutawakkil' <span class=\"gray\">(who trusts in Allah)</span>, not hard or harsh.' Neither uttering foul speech in the markets nor returning evil deed with one in kind. Rather, he forgives and forgoes. Allah will not end his life until He straightens through him the crooked religion, so that they might proclaim, 'There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.' He will open through him sealed hearts, deaf ears and blind eyes.'\" 'Ata' then said, \"I also met Ka'b and asked him the same question, and his answer did not differ from 'Abdullah's answer, even concerning one letter. \" Al-Bukhari recorded it from 'Abdullah bin 'Amr. It was also recorded by Al-Bukhari <span class=\"gray\">[up to the word]</span> forgoes. And he mentioned the narration of 'Abdullah bin 'Amr then he said; \"It was common in the speech of our Salaf that they describe the Books of the People of the Two Scriptures as the Tawrah, as some Hadiths concur. Allah knows best.\" </p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَأْمُرُهُم بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَاهُمْ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He commands them to do good; and forbids them from evil;)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the description of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in previous Books. These were the true qualities of our Messenger ﷺ, as well, for he only ordained good and forbade evil. We should mention here that 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud said, \"When you hear Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe!)</span>, then pay it your full attention, for it is a good that you are being commanded, or an evil that you are being forbidden.\" And the most important and greatest of these commands and prohibitions, is that Allah has sent the Messenger ﷺ to order worshipping Him Alone without partners and forbid worshipping others besides Him. This is the Message that Allah has sent all Messengers with before Muhammad ﷺ, just as Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger <span class=\"gray\">(proclaiming)</span>: \"Worship Allah, and avoid the Taghut <span class=\"gray\">(false deities)</span>\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[16:36]</span>. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيُحِلُّ لَهُمُ الطَّيِّبَاتِ وَيُحَرِّمُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْخَبَائِثَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He makes lawful for them the good things, and forbids them from the evil things,)</span> meaning, he makes the Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah and Ham, etc., lawful. They were prohibitions that they invented which were only hard for themselves. He also forbids them from evil things, such as the flesh of the pig, Riba, and foods that were treated as lawful although Allah the Exalted had forbidden them. 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported this from Ibn 'Abbas. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَضَعُ عَنْهُمْ إِصْرَهُمْ وَالْأَغْلَالَ الَّتِي كَانَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He <span class=\"gray\">(Muhammad)</span> releases them from their heavy burdens, and from the fetters that were upon them.)</span> indicates that Muhammad ﷺ came with leniency and an easy religion. As mentioned in the Hadith recorded from many routes that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بُعِثْتُ بِالْحَنِيفِيَّةِ السَّمْحَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I was sent with the easy way of Hanifiyyah <span class=\"gray\">[monotheism]</span>)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Prophet ﷺ said to the two Commanders he appointed, Mu'adh and Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari, when he sent them to Yemen,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَشِّرَا وَلَا تُنَفِّرَا وَيَسِّرَا وَلَا تُعَسِّرَا وَتَطَاوَعَا وَلَا تَخْتَلِفَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Bring glad tidings and do not drive people away, make things easy and do not make them difficult, obey each other and do not differ among yourselves)</span>. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abu Barzah Al-Aslami, the Prophet's Companion, said, \"I accompanied the Messenger of Allah and saw how easy he was. The nations that were before us had things made difficult for them in their laws. Allah made the law encompassing and easy for this Ummah. Hence the statement of the Messenger of Allah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ تَجَاوَزَ لِأُمَّتِي مَا حَدَّثَتْ بِهِ أَنْفُسُهَا مَا لَمْ تَقُلْ أَوْ تَعْمَل</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah has forgiven my Ummah for what occurs in themselves, as long as they do not utter it or act upon it.)</span></p><p lang=\"nl\" class=\"nl \">The Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رُفِعَ عَنْ أُمَّتِي الْخَطَأُ وَالنِّسْيَانُ وَمَا اسُتُكْرِهُوا عَلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(My Ummah was forgiven <span class=\"gray\">(by Allah)</span> unintentional errors, forgetfulness and what they are forced to do.)</span>\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is why Allah has guided this Ummah to proclaim,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبَّنَا لَا تُؤَاخِذْنَا إِن نَّسِينَا أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا رَبَّنَا وَلَا تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْنَا إِصْرًا كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِنَا رَبَّنَا وَلَا تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِ وَاعْفُ عَنَّا وَاغْفِرْ لَنَا وَارْحَمْنَا أَنتَ مَوْلَانَا فَانصُرْنَا عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْكَافِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us <span class=\"gray\">(Jews and Christians)</span>; our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Mawla <span class=\"gray\">(Patron, Supporter and Protector)</span> and give us victory over the disbelieving people.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:286]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It is recorded in Sahih Muslim that <span class=\"gray\">[the Prophet ﷺ said that]</span> Allah the Exalted said after every one of these supplications, \"I shall accept <span class=\"gray\">(your supplication)</span>.\" Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِهِ وَعَزَّرُوهُ وَنَصَرُوهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So those who believe in him, honor him, help him.)</span> refers to respecting and honoring Muhammad ﷺ,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاتَّبَعُوا النُّورَ الَّذِي أُنزِلَ مَعَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and follow the light which has been sent down with him,)</span> the Qur'an and the revelation <span class=\"gray\">[Sunnah]</span> that the Prophet delivered to mankind,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(it is they who will be successful.)</span> in this life and the Hereafter.</p>"
