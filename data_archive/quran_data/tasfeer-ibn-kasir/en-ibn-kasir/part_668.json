    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And thus We have revealed to you a Qur'an in Arabic that you may warn the Mother of the Towns and all around it, and warn <span class=\"gray\">(them)</span> of the Day of Assembling of which there is no doubt, a party will be in Paradise and a party in the blazing Fire <span>(7)</span>And if Allah had willed, He could have made them one nation, but He admits whom He wills to His mercy. And the wrongdoers will have neither a protector nor a helper <span>(8)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Qur'an was revealed to serve as a Warning</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah says, 'just as We sent revelation to the Prophets before you,'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ قُرْآنًا عَرَبِيًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(thus We have revealed to you a Qur'an in Arabic)</span> meaning, plain, clear, and manifest</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> لِتُنْذِرَ أُمَّ الْقُرَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that you may warn the Mother of the Towns)</span>, i.e., Makkah,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and all around it,)</span> means, all the lands, east and west. Makkah is called Umm Al-Qura <span class=\"gray\">(the Mother of the Towns)</span> because it is nobler than all other lands, as indicated by much evidence that has been discussed elsewhere. Among the most concise and clear proofs of that is the report recorded by Imam Ahmad from 'Abdullah bin 'Adi bin Al-Hamra' Az-Zuhri, who heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say, as he was standing in the market place of Makkah;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللهِ إِنَّكِ لَخَيْرُ أَرْضِ اللهِ وَأَحَبُّ أَرْضِ اللهِ إِلَى اللهِ، وَلَوْلَا أَنِّي أُخْرِجْتُ مِنْكِ مَا خَرَجْتُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By Allah, you are the best land of Allah, the most beloved land to Allah; were it not for the fact that I was driven out from you, I would never have left you.)</span> This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah; At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih. \"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتُنْذِرَ يَوْمَ الْجَمْعِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and warn <span class=\"gray\">(them)</span> of the Day of Assembling)</span> i.e., the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will assemble the first and the last in one plain.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(of which there is no doubt,)</span> means, there is no doubt that it will happen and will most certainly come to pass.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَرِيقٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ وَفَرِيقٌ فِي السَّعِيرِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(a party will be in Paradise and a party in the blazing Fire.)</span> This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُكُمْ لِيَوْمِ الْجَمْعِ ۖ ذَٰلِكَ يَوْمُ التَّغَابُنِ ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(And remember)</span> the Day when He will gather you <span class=\"gray\">(all)</span> on the Day of Gathering, – that will be the Day of mutual loss and gain)</span><span class=\"gray\">(64:9)</span>. which means that the people of Paradise and the people of Hell will gain and lose, respectively. And it is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَةً لِمَنْ خَافَ عَذَابَ الْآخِرَةِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ يَوْمٌ مَجْمُوعٌ لَهُ النَّاسُ وَذَٰلِكَ يَوْمٌ مَشْهُودٌ - وَمَا نُؤَخِّرُهُ إِلَّا لِأَجَلٍ مَعْدُودٍ - يَوْمَ يَأْتِ لَا تَكَلَّمُ نَفْسٌ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ ۚ فَمِنْهُمْ شَقِيٌّ وَسَعِيدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Indeed in that <span class=\"gray\">(there)</span> is a sure lesson for those who fear the torment of the Hereafter. That is a Day whereon will be gathered together, and that is a Day when all <span class=\"gray\">(the dwellers of the heavens and the earth)</span> will be present. And We delay it only for a term fixed. On the Day when it comes, no person shall speak except by His leave. Some among them will be wretched and <span class=\"gray\">(others)</span> blessed.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11:103-105)</span> Imam Ahmad recorded that 'Abdullah bin 'Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ came out to us, holding two books in his hand.

They asked him, 'What has caused you to weep? Didn't the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say to you,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خُذْ مِنْ شَارِبِكَ ثُمَّ أَقِرَّهُ حَتَّى تَلْقَانِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Trim your moustache and adhere to that practice until you meet me)</span>' He said, 'Yes, but I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَىٰ قَبَضَ بِيَمِينِهِ قَبْضَةً وَأُخْرَىٰ بِالْيَدِ الْأُخْرَىٰ، قَالَ: هٰذِهِ لِهٰذِهِ، وَهٰذِهِ لِهٰذِهِ، وَلَا أُبَالِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah picked up a handful in His Right Hand and another in His other Hand, and said, \"This is for this and this is for this, and I do not care.\")</span> 'And I do not know in which of the two handfuls I am.'\" There are several Hadiths about Al-Qadr <span class=\"gray\">(the Divine Decree)</span> in the books of Sahih, Sunan and Musnad. Including those narrated by 'Ali, Ibn Mas'ud, 'A'ishah and a large number of Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ لَجَعَلَهُمْ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if Allah had willed, He could have made them one nation,)</span> means, either all following guidance or all following misguidance, but He made them all different, and He guides whomsoever He wills to the truth and He sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He has complete wisdom and perfect proof. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَٰكِنْ يُدْخِلُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ فِي رَحْمَتِهِ ۚ وَالظَّالِمُونَ مَا لَهُمْ مِنْ وَلِيٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but He admits whom He wills to His mercy.
