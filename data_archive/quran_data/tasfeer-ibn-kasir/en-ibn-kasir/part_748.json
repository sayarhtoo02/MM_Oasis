    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend <span class=\"gray\">(to support them)</span> from their means. Therefore the righteous women are Qanitat, and guard in the husband's absence what Allah orders them to guard. As to those women on whose part you see ill conduct, admonish them, and abandon them in their beds, and beat them, but if they return to obedience, do not seek a means against them. Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great.) Allah sai <span>(34)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Men are the protectors and maintainers of women,)</span> meaning, the man is responsible for the woman, and he is her maintainer, caretaker and leader who disciplines her if she deviates.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(because Allah has made one of them to excel the other,)</span> meaning, because men excel over women and are better than them for certain tasks. This is why prophethood was exclusive of men, as well as other important positions of leadership. The Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَنْ يُفْلِحَ قَوْمٌ وَلَّوْا أَمْرَهُمُ امْرَأَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(People who appoint a woman to be their leader, will never achieve success.)</span> Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith. Such is the case with appointing women as judges or on other positions of leadership.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَبِمَا أَنفَقُوا مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and because they spend from their means.)</span> meaning the dowry, expenditures and various expenses that Allah ordained in His Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger for men to spend on women. For these reasons it is suitable that he is appointed her maintainer, just as Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيْهِنَّ دَرَجَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But men have a degree <span class=\"gray\">(of responsibility)</span> over them)</span>. <span class=\"gray\">[2:228]</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Qualities of the Righteous Wife</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَالصَّالِحَاتُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Therefore, the righteous)</span> women,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">قَانِتَاتٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(are Qanitat)</span>, obedient to their husbands, as Ibn 'Abbas and others stated.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and guard in the husband's absence)</span> As-Suddi and others said that it means she protects her honor and her husband's property when he is absent, and Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(what Allah orders them to guard.)</span> means, the protected <span class=\"gray\">[husband]</span> is the one whom Allah protects. Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خَيْرُ النِّسَاءِ امْرَأَةٌ إِذَا نَظَرْتَ إِلَيْهَا سَرَّتْكَ، وَإِذَا أَمَرْتَهَا أَطَاعَتْكَ، وَإِذَا غِبْتَ عَنْهَا حَفِظَتْكَ فِي نَفْسِهَا وَمَالِكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The best women is she who when you look at her, she pleases you, when you command her she obeys you, and when you are absent, she protects her honor and your property.)</span> Then, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Men are the protectors and maintainers of women,)</span> until its end. Imam Ahmad recorded that 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا صَلَّتِ الْمَرْأَةُ خَمْسَهَا، وَصَامَتْ شَهْرَهَا، وَحَفِظَتْ فَرْجَهَا، وَأَطَاعَتْ زَوْجَهَا، قِيلَ لَهَا: ادْخُلِي الْجَنَّةَ مِنْ أَيِّ الْأَبْوَابِ شِئْتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If the woman prayed her five daily prayers, fasted her month, protected her chastity and obeyed her husband, she will be told, 'Enter Paradise from any of its doors you wish.')</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Dealing with the Wife's Ill-Conduct</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَاللَّاتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(As to those women on whose part you see ill conduct,)</span> meaning, the woman from whom you see ill conduct with her husband, such as when she acts as if she is above her husband, disobeys him, ignores him, dislikes him, and so forth. When these signs appear in a woman, her husband should advise her and remind her of Allah's torment if she disobeys him. Indeed, Allah ordered the wife to obey her husband and prohibited her from disobeying him, because of the enormity of his rights and all that he does for her. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَوْ كُنْتُ آمِرًا أَحَدًا أَنْ يَسْجُدَ لِأَحَدٍ، لَأَمَرْتُ الْمَرْأَةَ أَنْ تَسْجُدَ لِزَوْجِهَا، مِنْ عِظَمِ حَقِّهِ عَلَيْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If I were to command anyone to prostrate before anyone, I would have commanded the wife to prostrate before her husband, because of the enormity of his right upon her.)</span></p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا دَعَا الرَّجُلُ امْرَأَتَهُ إِلى فِرَاشِهِ فَأَبَتْ عَلَيْهِ، لَعَنَتْهَا الْمَلَائِكَةُ حَتَّى تُصْبِحَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If the man asks his wife to come to his bed and she declines, the angels will keep cursing her until the morning.)</span> Muslim recorded it with the wording,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا بَاتَتِ الْمَرْأَةُ هَاجِرَةً فِرَاشَ زَوْجِهَا، لَعَنَتْهَا الْمَلَائِكَةُ حَتَّى تُصْبِحَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If the wife goes to sleep while ignoring her husband's bed, the angels will keep cursing her until the morning.)</span> This is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَاللَّاتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(As to those women on whose part you see ill conduct, admonish them <span class=\"gray\">(first)</span>)</span>. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِي الْمَضَاجِعِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(abandon them in their beds,)</span> 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas said \"The abandonment refers to not having intercourse with her, to lie on her bed with his back to her.\" Several others said similarly. As-Suddi, Ad-Dahhak, 'Ikrimah, and Ibn 'Abbas, in another narration, added, \"Not to speak with her or talk to her.\" The Sunan and Musnad compilers recorded that Mu'awiyah bin Haydah Al-Qushayri said, \"O Allah's Messenger! What is the right that the wife of one of us has on him?\" The Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنْ تُطْعِمَهَا إِذَا طَعِمْتَ، وَتَكْسُوَهَا إِذَا اكْتَسَيْتَ، وَلَا تَضْرِبِ الْوَجْهَ، وَلَا تُقَبِّحْ، وَلَا تَهْجُرْ إِلَّا فِي الْبَيْتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(To feed her when you eat, cloth her when you buy clothes for yourself, refrain from striking her face or cursing her, and to not abandon her, except in the house.)</span> Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(beat them)</span> means, if advice and ignoring her in the bed do not produce the desired results, you are allowed to discipline the wife, without severe beating. Muslim recorded that Jabir said that during the Farewell Hajj, the Prophet ﷺ said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاتَّقُوا اللهَ فِي النِّسَاءِ، فَإِنَّهُنَّ عِنْدَكُمْ عَوَانٍ، وَلَكُمْ عَلَيْهِنَّ أَنْ لَا يُوطِئْنَ فُرُشَكُمْ أَحَدًا تَكْرَهُونَهُ، فَإِنْ فَعَلْنَ ذَلِكَ فَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ ضَرْبًا غَيْرَ مُبَرِّحٍ، وَلَهُنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ رِزْقُهُنَّ وَكِسْوَتُهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Fear Allah regarding women, for they are your assistants. You have the right on them that they do not allow any person whom you dislike to step on your mat. However, if they do that, you are allowed to discipline them lightly. They have a right on you that you provide them with their provision and clothes, in a reasonable manner.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas and several others said that the Ayah refers to a beating that is not violent. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that it means, a beating that is not severe.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>When the Wife Obeys Her Husband, Means of Annoyance Against Her are Prohibited</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلَا تَبْغُوا عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means <span class=\"gray\">(of annoyance)</span>,)</span> meaning, when the wife obeys her husband in all that Allah has allowed, then no means of annoyance from the husband are allowed against his wife. Therefore, in this case, the husband does not have the right to beat her or shun her bed. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيًّا كَبِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great.)</span> reminds men that if they transgress against their wives without justification, then Allah, the Ever Most High, Most Great, is their Protector, and He will exert revenge on those who transgress against their wives and deal with them unjustly.</p>"

Indeed Allah is Ever All-Knower, Well-Acquainted with all things <span>(35)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Appointing Two Arbitrators When the Possibility of Estrangement Between Husband and Wife Occurs</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah first mentioned the case of rebellion on the part of the wife. He then mentioned the case of estrangement and alienation between the two spouses. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ شِقَاقَ بَيْنِهِمَا فَابْعَثُوا حَكَمًا مِّنْ أَهْلِهِ وَحَكَمًا مِّنْ أَهْلِهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If you fear a breach between the two, appoint <span class=\"gray\">(two)</span> arbitrators, one from his family)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Fuqaha' <span class=\"gray\">(scholars of Fiqh)</span> say that when estrangement occurs between the husband and wife, the judge refers them to a trusted person who examines their case in order to stop any wrongs commited between them. If the matter continues or worsens, the judge sends a trustworthy person from the woman's family and a trustworthy person from the man's family to meet with them and examine their case to determine whether it is best for them to part or to remain together. Allah gives preference to staying together, and this is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِن يُرِيدَا إِصْلَاحًا يُوَفِّقِ اللَّهُ بَيْنَهُمَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Allah commands that a righteous man from the husband's side of the family and the wife's side of the family are appointed, so that they find out who among the spouses is in the wrong. If the man is in the wrong, they prevent him from his wife, and he pays some restitution. If the wife is in the wrong, she remains with her husband, and he does not pay any restitution. If the arbitrators decide that the marriage should remain intact or be dissolved, then their decision is upheld. If they decide that the marriage remains intact, but one of the spouses disagrees while the other agrees, and one of them dies, then the one who agreed inherits from the other, while the spouse who did not agree does not inherit from the spouse who agreed.\" This was collected by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Shaykh Abu 'Umar bin 'Abdul-Barr said, \"The scholars agree that when the two arbitrators disagree, then the opinion that dissolves the marriage will not be adopted. They also agree that the decision of the arbitrators is binding, even if the two spouses did not appoint them as agents. This is the case if it is decided that they should stay together, but they disagree whether it is binding or not when they decide for separation.\" Then he mentioned that the majority holds the view that the decision is still binding, even if they did not appoint them to make any decision.</p>"
