    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And of mankind there is he whose speech may please you <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad ﷺ)</span>, in this worldly life, and he calls Allah to witness as to that which is in his heart, yet he is the most quarrelsome of the opponents <span>(204)</span>And when he turns away <span class=\"gray\">(from you O Muhammad )</span>, his effort in the land is to make mischief therein and to destroy the crops and the cattle, and Allah likes not mischief <span>(205)</span>And when it is said to him, \"Fear Allah\", he is led by arrogance to <span class=\"gray\">(more)</span> crime. So enough for him is Hell, and worst indeed is that place to rest <span>(206)</span>And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is full of kindness to <span class=\"gray\">(His)</span> servants <span>(207)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Characteristics of the Hypocrites</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">As-Suddi said that these Ayat were revealed about Al-Akhnas bin Shariq Ath-Thaqafi who came to Allah's Messenger ﷺ and announced his Islam although his heart concealed otherwise.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas narrated that these Ayat were revealed about some of the hypocrites who criticized Khubayb and his companions who were killed during the Raji' incident. Thereafter, Allah sent down His condemnation of the hypocrites and His praise for Khubayb and his companions:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِي نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَاءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was also said that they refer to the hypocrites and the believers in general. This is the opinion of Qatadah, Mujahid, Ar-Rabi' bin Anas and several others, and it is correct.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Jarir related that Al-Qurazi said that Nawf Al-Bikali, who used to read <span class=\"gray\">(previous Divine)</span> Books said, \"I find the description of some members of this Ummah in the previously revealed Books of Allah: they <span class=\"gray\">(hypocrites)</span> are people who use the religion to gain material benefit. Their tongues are sweeter than honey, but their hearts are more bitter than Sabir <span class=\"gray\">(a bitter plant, aloe)</span>. They show the people the appearance of sheep while their hearts hide the viciousness of wolves. Allah said, 'They dare challenge Me, but they are deceived by Me. I swear by Myself that I will send a Fitnah <span class=\"gray\">(trial, calamity)</span> on them that will make the wise man bewildered.' I contemplated about these statements and found them in the Qur'an describing the hypocrites:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يُعْجِبُكَ قَوْلُهُ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَيُشْهِدُ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا فِي قَلْبِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And of mankind there is he whose speech may please you <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad ﷺ)</span>, in this worldly life, and he calls Allah to witness as to that which is in his heart,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This statement by Al-Qurazi is Hasan Sahih. Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيُشْهِدُ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا فِي قَلْبِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...and he calls Allah to witness as to that which is in his heart,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Ayah indicates that such people pretend to be Muslims, but defy Allah by the disbelief and hypocrisy that their hearts conceal. Similarly Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَلَا يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They may hide <span class=\"gray\">(their crimes)</span> from men, but they cannot hide <span class=\"gray\">(them)</span> from Allah.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:108)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Tafsir was reported from Ibn 'Abbas by Ibn Ishaq. It was also said that the Ayah means that when such people announce their Islam, they swear by Allah that what is in their hearts is the same of what their tongues are pronouncing. This is also a correct meaning for the Ayah that was chosen by 'Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. It is also the choice of Ibn Jarir who related it to Ibn 'Abbas and Mujahid. Allah knows best.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ أَلَدُّ الْخِصَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yet he is the most Aladd of the opponents.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:204)</span> lThe Ayah used the word Aladd here, which literally means 'wicked' <span class=\"gray\">(here it means 'quarrelsome')</span>. A variation of the word Ludda was also used in another Ayah:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\"> وَتُنذِرَ بِهِ قَوْمًا لُّدًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So that you <span class=\"gray\">(Muhammad)</span> warn with it <span class=\"gray\">(the Qur'an)</span> a Ludda people.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(19:97)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Hence, a hypocrite lies, alters the truth when he quarrels and does not care for the truth. Rather, he deviates from the truth, deceives and becomes most quarrelsome. It is reported in Sahih that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">آيَةُ الْمُنَافِقِ ثَلاثٌ: إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإذَا عَاهَدَ غَدَرَ، وَإِذَا خَاصَمَ فَجَرَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The signs of a hypocrite are three: Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie. Whenever he promises, he always breaks it <span class=\"gray\">(his promise)</span>. If you have a dispute with him, he is most quarrelsome.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Bukhari reported that 'A'ishah narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ أَبْغَضَ الرِّجَالِ إلَى اللهِ الْألَدُّ الْخَصِمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The most hated person to Allah is he who is Aladd and Khasim <span class=\"gray\">(meaning most quarrelsome)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah then said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا تَوَلَّىٰ سَعَىٰ فِي الْأَرْضِ لِيُفْسِدَ فِيهَا وَيُهْلِكَ الْحَرْثَ وَالنَّسْلَ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْفَسَادَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when he turns away <span class=\"gray\">(from you O Muhammad)</span>, he struggles in the land to make mischief therein and to destroy the crops and the cattle, and Allah likes not mischief.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Ayah indicates that such persons are deviant in the tongue, evil in the deeds, their words are fabricated, their belief is wicked and their works are immoral. The Ayah used the <span class=\"gray\">(Arabic word)</span> Sa'a <span class=\"gray\">(literally, 'tries' or 'intends')</span>. This word was also used to describe Pharaoh:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ يَسْعَىٰ - فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَىٰ - فَقَالَ أَنَا رَبُّكُمُ الْأَعْلَىٰ - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الْآخِرَةِ وَالْأُولَىٰ - إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then he turned his back, Yas'a <span class=\"gray\">(striving hard against Allah)</span>. Then he gathered <span class=\"gray\">(his people)</span> and cried aloud saying, 'I am your lord, most high.' So Allah, seized him with a punishing example for his last and first transgression. Verily, in this is an instructive admonition for whosoever fears Allah.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(79:22-26)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">[Sa'a was also used in the Ayah]</span>:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا نُودِيَ لِلصَّلَاةِ مِن يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ فَاسْعَوْا إِلَىٰ ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe <span class=\"gray\">(Muslims)</span>! When the call is proclaimed for the Salah <span class=\"gray\">(prayer)</span> on the day of Friday <span class=\"gray\">(Jumu'ah prayer)</span>, As'aw come to the remembrance of Allah.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(62:9)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Ayah means, '<span class=\"gray\">(when the call to the Friday prayer is announced)</span> intend and then proceed to attend the Friday prayer.' We should mention that hastening to the mosque is condemed by the Sunnah <span class=\"gray\">(as this is another meaning for the word Sa'a)</span>:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إذَا أَتَيْتُمُ الصَّلَاةَ فَلَا تَأْتُوهَا وَأَنْتُمْ تَسْعَوْنَ، وَأْتُوهَا وَعَلَيْكُمُ السَّكِينَةُ والْوَقَارُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When you come to attend the prayer, do not come in a Sa'i <span class=\"gray\">(haste)</span>. Rather, come to it while walking at ease and in peace <span class=\"gray\">(or grace)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The hypocrite has no motive in this life but to cause mischief and to destroy the crops and the offspring, including what the animals produce and what the people depend on for their livelihood. Mujahid said, \"If the hypocrite strives for mischief in the land, Allah prevents the rain from falling and thus the crops and the offspring perish.\" The Ayah continues:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْفَسَادَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...and Allah likes not mischief.)</span> that is, Allah does not like those who possess these characteristics, or those who act like this.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Rejecting Advice is Characteristic of the Hypocrites</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُ اتَّقِ اللَّهَ أَخَذَتْهُ الْعِزَّةُ بِالْإِثْمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when it is said to him, \"Fear Allah\", he is led by arrogance to <span class=\"gray\">(more)</span> crime.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Ayah indicates that when the hypocrite, who deviates in his speech and deeds, is advised and commanded to fear Allah, refrain from his evil deeds and adhere to the truth, he refuses and becomes angry and outraged, as he is used to doing evil. This Ayah is similar to what Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُنَا بَيِّنَاتٍ تَعْرِفُ فِي وُجُوهِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا الْمُنكَرَ يَكَادُونَ يَسْطُونَ بِالَّذِينَ يَتْلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتِنَا قُلْ أَفَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِشَرٍّ مِّن ذَٰلِكُمُ النَّارُ وَعَدَهَا اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when Our clear verses are recited to them, you will notice a denial on the faces of the disbelievers! They are nearly ready to attack with violence those who recite Our verses to them. Say: \"Shall I tell you of something worse than that? The Fire <span class=\"gray\">(of Hell)</span> which Allah has promised to those who disbelieved, and worst indeed is that destination!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(22:72)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is why in this Ayah, Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> فَحَسْبُهُ جَهَنَّمُ وَلَبِئْسَ الْمِهَادُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So enough for him is Hell, and worst indeed is that place to rest)</span> meaning, the Fire is enough punishment for the hypocrite.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Sincere Believer prefers pleasing Allah</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِي نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَاءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">After Allah described the evil characteristics of the hypocrites, He mentioned the good qualities of the believers. Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِي نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَاءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas, Anas, Sa'id bin Musayyib, Abu 'Uthman An-Nahdi, 'Ikrimah and several other scholars said that this Ayah was revealed about Suhayb bin Sinan Ar-Rumi. When Suhayb became a Muslim in Makkah and intended to migrate <span class=\"gray\">(to Al-Madinah)</span>, the people <span class=\"gray\">(Quraysh)</span> prevented him from migrating with his money. They said that if he forfeits his property, he is free to migrate. He abandoned his money and preferred to migrate, and Allah revealed this Ayah about him. 'Umar bin Khattab and several other Companions met Suhayb close to the outskirts of Al-Madinah at Al-Harrah <span class=\"gray\">(flat lands with black stones)</span>. They said to him, \"The trade has indeed been successful.\" He answered them, \"You too, may Allah never allow your trade to fail. What is the matter?\" 'Umar told him that Allah has revealed this Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:207)</span> about him. It was also reported that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said, \"The trade has been successful, O Suhayb!\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The meaning of the Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:207)</span> includes every Mujahid in the way of Allah. Allah said in another Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ اشْتَرَىٰ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَمْوَالَهُم بِأَنَّ لَهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ يُقَاتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَيَقْتُلُونَ وَيُقْتَلُونَ وَعْدًا عَلَيْهِ حَقًّا فِي التَّوْرَاةِ وَالْإِنجِيلِ وَالْقُرْآنِ وَمَنْ أَوْفَىٰ بِعَهْدِهِ مِنَ اللَّهِ فَاسْتَبْشِرُوا بِبَيْعِكُمُ الَّذِي بَايَعْتُم بِهِ وَذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for <span class=\"gray\">(the price)</span> that theirs shall be the Paradise. They fight in Allah's cause, so they kill <span class=\"gray\">(others)</span> and are killed. It is a promise in truth which is binding on Him in the Tawrah and the Injil and the Qur'an. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah? Then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded. That is the supreme success.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(9:111)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When Hisham bin 'Amr penetrated the lines of the enemy, some people criticized him. 'Umar bin Al-Khattab and Abu Hurayrah refuted them and recited this Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِي نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَاءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ رَءُوفٌ بِالْعِبَادِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is full of kindness to <span class=\"gray\">(His)</span> servants.)</span></p>"
