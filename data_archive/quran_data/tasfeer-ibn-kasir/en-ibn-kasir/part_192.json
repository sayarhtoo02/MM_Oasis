As Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِن تَعْجَبْ فَعَجَبٌ قَوْلُهُمْ أَإِذَا كُنَّا تُرَابًا أَإِنَّا لَفِي خَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if you wonder, then wondrous is their saying: \"When we are dust, shall we indeed then be <span class=\"gray\">(raised)</span> in a new creation?\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[13:5]</span> Allah also says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوَلَمْ يَرَ الإِنسَـنُ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَـهُ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ فَإِذَا هُوَ خَصِيمٌ مٌّبِينٌ - وَضَرَبَ لَنَا مَثَلاً وَنَسِىَ خَلْقَهُ قَالَ مَن يُحىِ الْعِظَـمَ وَهِىَ رَمِيمٌ - قُلْ يُحْيِيهَا الَّذِى أَنشَأَهَآ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ خَلْقٍ عَلِيمٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Does not man see that We have created him from Nutfah. Yet behold he <span class=\"gray\">(stands forth)</span> as an open opponent. And he puts forth for Us a parable and forgets his own creation. He says: \"Who will give life to these bones after they are rotten and have become dust?\" Say: \"He will give life to them Who created them for the first time! And He is the All-Knower of every creation!\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[36:77-79]</span> And Allah says here in this Surah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَقُولُ الْإِنسَانُ أَإِذَا مَا مِتُّ لَسَوْفَ أُخْرَجُ حَيًّا - أَوَلَا يَذْكُرُ الْإِنسَانُ أَنَّا خَلَقْنَاهُ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَمْ يَكُ شَيْئًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And man says: \"When I am dead, shall I then be raised up alive?\" Does not man remember that We created him before, while he was nothing?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah uses the beginning of creation as a proof for its repetition. This means that He, the Exalted, created the human being while he was nothing. So can he not repeat this creation after the human had actually become something? Similalry Allah says;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[30:27]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In the Sahih it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: كَذَّبَنِي ابْنُ آدَمَ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ أَنْ يُكَذِّبَنِي، وَآذَانِي ابْنُ آدَمَ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ أَنْ يُؤْذِيَنِي، أَمَّا تَكْذِيبُهُ إِيَّايَ فَقَوْلُهُ لَنْ يُعِيدَنِي كَمَا بَدَأَنِي، وَلَيْسَ أَوَّلُ الْخَلْقِ بِأَهْوَنَ عَلَيَّ مِنْ آخِرِهِ، وَأَمَّا أَذَاهُ إِيَّايَ فَقَوْلُهُ إِنَّ لِي وَلَدًا وَأَنَا الْأَحَدُ الصَّمَدُ الَّذِي لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah, the Exalted said, \"The son of Adam denies Me and he has no right to deny Me. The son of Adam harms Me and he has no right to harm Me. His denial of Me is his statement that I will never repeat His creation like I created him the first time. Yet, the second creation is not more difficult upon Me than the first. His harming Me is his statement that I have a son. Yet, I am One Alone, the Self-Sufficient Whom all creatures need. He Who does not beget children, nor was He born and there is none coequal or comparable unto Him.\")</span> Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَوَرَبِّكَ لَنَحْشُرَنَّهُمْ وَالشَّيَاطِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So by your Lord, surely We shall gather them together, and the Shayatin,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Lord, Blessed be He the Most High, swears by His Noble Self that He will definitely gather all of those who worshipped other than Allah and their devils as well.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ لَنُحْضِرَنَّهُمْ حَوْلَ جَهَنَّمَ جِثِيًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(then We shall bring them round Hell, Jithiyya.)</span> Al-'Awfi related that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"This means sitting and it is similar to His statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَرَىٰ كُلَّ أُمَّةٍ جَاثِيَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And you will see each nation Jathiyah.)</span>\" <span class=\"gray\">[45:28]</span> As-Suddi commented on the word Jithiyya, \"It means standing.\" It has been reported from Murrah that Ibn Mas'ud said the same. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ لَنَنزِعَنَّ مِن كُلِّ شِيعَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then indeed We shall drag out from every sect)</span> This means from every nation. This is what Mujahid said.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَيُّهُمْ أَشَدُّ عَلَى الرَّحْمَٰنِ عِتِيًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against the Most Gracious.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ath-Thawri reported from 'Ali bin Al-Aqmar, from Abu Al-Ahwas, from Ibn Mas'ud that he said, \"The first of them will be bound to the last of them until their number is complete. Then, they will be brought all together. Then, Allah will begin with the greatest of them in crime and continue in succession. That is Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ لَنَنزِعَنَّ مِن كُلِّ شِيعَةٍ أَيُّهُمْ أَشَدُّ عَلَى الرَّحْمَٰنِ عِتِيًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then indeed We shall drag out from every sect all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against the Most Gracious.)</span> This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَتَّىٰ إِذَا ادَّارَكُوا فِيهَا جَمِيعًا قَالَتْ أُخْرَاهُمْ لِأُولَاهُمْ رَبَّنَا هَٰؤُلَاءِ أَضَلُّونَا فَآتِهِمْ عَذَابًا ضِعْفًا مِّنَ النَّارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Until they will be gathered all together in the Fire. The last of them will say to the first of them: \"Our Lord! These misled us, so give them a double torment of the Fire.\")</span> Until His saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَكْسِبُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(For what you used to earn.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[7:38-39]</span> The first of them will say to the last of them: \"Your were not better than us, so taste the torment for what you used to earn.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ لَنَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِالَّذِينَ هُمْ أَوْلَىٰ بِهَا صِلِيًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then, verily, We know best those who are most worthy of being burnt therein.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then, at this point Allah attaches one piece of information to another. The meaning here is that Allah best knows which of His creatures deserve to be burned in the fire of Hell and remain there forever and who deserves to have his punishment doubled. This is as He says in the Ayah that was previously mentioned,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ لِكُلٍّ ضِعْفٌ وَلَٰكِن لَّا تَعْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He will say: \"For each one there is double <span class=\"gray\">(torment)</span>, but you know not.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[7:38]</span></p>"
