    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Remember)</span> when the wife of 'Imran said: \"O my Lord! I have vowed to You what is in my womb to be dedicated for Your services, so accept this from me. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knowing. <span>(35)</span>Then when she gave birth to her, she said: \"O my Lord! I have given birth to a female child, ـ and Allah knew better what she bore, ـ \"And the male is not like the female, and I have named her Maryam, and I seek refuge with You for her and for her offspring from Shaytan, the outcast. <span>(36)</span></p><div lang=\"mg\" class=\"mg \"><h2>The Story of Maryam's Birth</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The wife of 'Imran mentioned here is the mother of Maryam, and her name is Hannah bint Faqudh. Muhammad bin Ishaq mentioned that Hannah could not have children and that one day, she saw a bird feeding its chick. She wished she could have children and supplicated to Allah to grant her offspring. Allah accepted her supplication, and when her husband slept with her, she became pregnant. She vowed to make her child concentrate on worship and serving Bayt Al-Maqdis <span class=\"gray\">(the Masjid in Jerusalem)</span>, when she became aware that she was pregnant. She said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبِّ إِنِّي نَذَرْتُ لَكَ مَا فِي بَطْنِي مُحَرَّرًا فَتَقَبَّلْ مِنِّي إِنَّكَ أَنتَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O my Lord! I have vowed to You what is in my womb to be dedicated for Your services, so accept this from me. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knowing.)</span> meaning, You hear my supplication and You know my intention. She did not know then what she would give birth to, a male or a female.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَمَّا وَضَعَتْهَا قَالَتْ رَبِّ إِنِّي وَضَعْتُهَا أُنثَىٰ وَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا وَضَعَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then when she gave birth to her, she said: \"O my Lord! I have given birth to a female child, ـ and Allah knew better what she bore.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَيْسَ الذَّكَرُ كَالْأُنثَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the male is not like the female,)</span> in strength and the commitment to worship Allah and serve the Masjid in Jerusalem.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَإِنِّي سَمَّيْتُهَا مَرْيَمَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And I have named her Maryam,)</span> thus, testifying to the fact that it is allowed to give a name to the newly born the day it is born, as is apparent from the Ayah, which is also a part of the law of those who were before us. Further, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ mentioned that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وُلِدَ لِيَ اللَّيْلَةَ وَلَدٌ، سَمَّيْتُهُ بِاسْمِ أَبِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(This night, a son was born for me and I called him by my father's name, Ibrahim.)</span> Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">They also recorded that Anas bin Malik brought his newborn brother to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who chewed a piece of date and put it in the child's mouth and called him 'Abdullah. Other new born infants were also given names on the day they were born.</p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">Qatadah narrated that Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, that Samurah bin Jundub said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُّ غُلَامٍ رَهِينٌ بِعَقِيقَتِهِ، يُذْبَحُ عَنْهُ يَوْمَ سَابِعِهِ، وَيُسَمَّى وَيُحْلَقُ رَأَسُهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Every new born boy held in security by his 'Aqiqah, until his seventh day, a sacrifice is offered on his behalf, he is given a name, and the hair on his head is shaved.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Hadith was collected by Ahmad and the collectors of the Sunan, and was graded Sahih by At-Tirmidhi. We should mention that another narration for this Hadith contained the wording, \"and blood is offered on his behalf,\" which is more famous and established than the former narration, and Allah knows best.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah's statement that Maryam's mother said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنِّي أُعِيذُهَا بِكَ وَذُرِّيَّتَهَا مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"...And I seek refuge with You for her and for her offspring from Shaytan, the outcast.\")</span> means, that she sought refuge with Allah from the evil of Shaytan, for her and her offspring, i.e., 'Isa, peace be upon him. Allah accepted her supplication, for 'Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا مِنْ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ إِلَّا مَسَّهُ الشَّيْطَانُ حِينَ يُولَدُ، فَيَسْتَهِلُّ صَارِخًا مِنْ مَسِّهِ إِيَّاهُ، إِلَّا مَرْيَمَ وَابْنَهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Every newly born baby is touched by Shaytan when it is born, and the baby starts crying because of this touch, except Maryam and her son.)</span></p><p lang=\"yo\" class=\"yo \">Abu Hurayrah then said, \"Read if you will,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنِّي أُعِيذُهَا بِكَ وَذُرِّيَّتَهَا مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And I seek refuge with You for her and for her offspring from Shaytan, the outcast)</span>.\" The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith.</p>"

Allah made Zakariyya Maryam's guardian for her benefit, so that she would learn from his tremendous knowledge and righteous conduct. He was the husband of her maternal aunt, as Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Jarir stated, or her brother-in-law, as mentioned in the Sahih,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِذَا بِيَحْيَى وَعِيسىٰ، وَهُمَا ابْنَا الْخَالَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I saw John and 'Isa, who are maternal cousins.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">We should state that in general terms, what Ibn Ishaq said is plausible, and in this case, Maryam was under the care of her maternal aunt. The Two Sahihs recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ decided that 'Amarah, the daughter of Hamzah, be raised by her maternal aunt, the wife of Ja'far bin Abi Talib, saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْخَالَةُ بِمَنْزِلَةِ الْأُمِّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The maternal aunt is just like the mother.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah then emphasizes Maryam's honor and virtue at the place of worship she attended,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلَّمَا دَخَلَ عَلَيْهَا زَكَرِيَّا الْمِحْرَابَ وَجَدَ عِندَهَا رِزْقًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Every time he entered the Mihrab to <span class=\"gray\">(visit)</span> her, he found her supplied with sustenance.)</span></p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">Mujahid, 'Ikrimah, Sa'id bin Jubayr, Abu Ash-Sha'tha, Ibrahim An-Nakha'i, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi' bin Anas, 'Atiyah Al-'Awfi and As-Suddi said, \"He would find with her the fruits of the summer during winter, and the fruits of the winter during summer.\" When Zakariyya would see this;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ يَا مَرْيَمُ أَنَّىٰ لَكِ هَٰذَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He said: \"O Maryam!
