The one who knows them not, thinks that they are rich because of their modesty. You may know them by their mark, they do not beg of people at all.

Therefore, you will not be asked about the deeds <span class=\"gray\">[or wickedness]</span> of those who receive it.\" This is a sound meaning indicating that when one spends in charity for Allah's sake, then his reward will be with Allah. He will not be asked if the charity unintentionally reached righteous, evil, deserving or undeserving persons, for he will be rewarded for his good intention. The proof to this statement is the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا تُنفِقُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تُظْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whatever you spend in good, it will be repaid to you in full, and you shall not be wronged.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Two Sahihs recorded a Hadith by Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ رَجُلٌ: لَأَتَصَدَّقَنَّ اللَّيْلَةَ بِصَدَقَةٍ، فَخَرجَ بِصَدَقَتِهِ فَوَضَعَهَا فِي يَدِ زَانِيَةٍ، فَأَصْبَحَ النَّاسُ يَتَحَدَّثُونَ: تُصُدِّقَ عَلَى زَانِيَةٍ، فَقَالَ: اللَّهُمَ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ عَلَى زَانِيَةٍ، لَأَتَصَدَّقَنَّ اللَّيْلَةَ بِصَدَقَةٍ، فَخَرَجَ بِصَدَقَتِهِ فَوَضَعَهَا فِي يَدِ غَنِيٍّ، فَأَصْبَحُوا يَتَحَدَّثُونَ: تُصُدِّقَ اللَّيْلَةَ عَلَى غَنِيٍّ، قَالَ: اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ عَلَى غَنِيٍّ، لَأَتَصَدَّقَنَّ اللَّيْلَةَ بِصَدَقَةٍ، فَخَرَجَ بِصَدَقَتِهِ فَوَضَعَهَا فِي يَدِ سَارِقٍ، فَأَصْبَحُوا يَتَحَدَّثُونَ: تُصُدِّقَ اللَّيْلَةَ عَلَى سَارِقٍ، فَقَالَ: اللَّهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ عَلَى زَانِيَةٍ، وَعَلَى غَنِيٍّ، وَعَلَى سَارِقٍ. فَأُتِيَ فَقِيلَ لَهُ: أَمَّا صَدَقَتُكَ فَقَدْ قُبِلَتْ، وَأَمَّا الزَّانِيَةُ فَلَعَلَّهَا أَنْ تَسْتَعِفَّ بِهَا عَنْ زِنَاهَا، وَلَعَلَّ الْغَنِيَّ يَعْتَبِرُ فَيُنْفِقُ مِمَّا أَعْطَاهُ اللهُ، وَلَعَلَّ السَّارِقَ أَنْ يَسْتَعِفَّ بِهَا عَنْ سَرِقَتِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(A man said, \"Tonight, I shall give charity.\" He went out with his charity and <span class=\"gray\">(unknowingly)</span> gave it to an adulteress. The next morning the people said that alms were given to an adulteress. The man said, \"O Allah! All the praises are for You. <span class=\"gray\">(I gave my alms)</span> to an adulteress. Tonight, I shall give alms again.\" He went out with his charity and <span class=\"gray\">(unknowingly)</span> gave it to a rich person. The next morning <span class=\"gray\">(the people)</span> said, \"Last night, a wealthy person was given alms.\" He said, \"O Allah! All the praises are for You. <span class=\"gray\">(I gave alms)</span> to a wealthy man. Tonight, I shall again give charity.\" So he went out with his charity and <span class=\"gray\">(unknowingly)</span> gave it to a thief. The next morning <span class=\"gray\">(the people)</span> said, \"Last night, a thief was given alms.\" He said, \"O Allah! All the praises are for You. <span class=\"gray\">(I have given alms)</span> to an adulteress, a wealthy man and a thief.\" Then, someone came to him and said, \"The alms that you gave away were accepted. As for the adulteress, the alms might make her abstain from adultery. As for the wealthy man, it might make him take a lesson and spend his wealth that Allah has given him. As for the thief, it might make him abstain from stealing.\")</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Who Deserves Charity</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِلْفُقَرَاءِ الَّذِينَ أُحْصِرُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(Charity is)</span> for the poor, who in Allah's cause are restricted <span class=\"gray\">(from travel)</span>)</span> meaning, the migrants who migrated to Allah and His Messenger, resided in Al-Madinah and did not have resources that sufficiently provided them with their needs,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ضَرْبًا فِي الْأَرْضِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And cannot Darban <span class=\"gray\">(move about)</span> in the land)</span> meaning, \"They cannot travel in the land to seek means of livelihood.\" Allah said in other instances <span class=\"gray\">[using a variation of the word Darban]</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَقْصُرُوا مِنَ الصَّلَاةِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when you <span class=\"gray\">(Muslims)</span> travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten the Salah <span class=\"gray\">(the prayer)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">[4:101]</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَلِمَ أَن سَيَكُونُ مِنكُم مَّرْضَىٰ وَآخَرُونَ يَضْرِبُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ يَبْتَغُونَ مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَآخَرُونَ يُقَاتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He knows that there will be some among you sick, others traveling through the land, seeking of Allah's bounty, yet others fighting in Allah's cause)</span><span class=\"gray\">[73:20]</span>.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَحْسَبُهُمُ الْجَاهِلُ أَغْنِيَاءَ مِنَ التَّعَفُّفِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The one who knows them not, thinks that they are rich because of their modesty)</span> meaning, those who do not know their situation think that they are well-off, because they are modest in their clothes and speech. There is a Hadith with this meaning that the Two Sahihs recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيْسَ الْمِسْكِينُ بِهذَا الطَّوَّافِ الَّذِي تَرُدُّهُ التَّمْرَةُ وَالتَّمْرَتَانِ، وَاللُّقْمَةُ وَاللُّقْمَتَانِ، وَالْأُكْلَةُ وَالْأُكْلَتَانِ، وَلكِنِ الْمِسْكِينُ الَّذِي لَا يَجِدُ غِنىً يُغْنِيهِ، وَلَا يُفْطَنُ لَهُ فَيُتَصَدَّقَ عَلَيْهِ، وَلَا يَسْأَلُ النَّاسَ شَيْئًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Miskin <span class=\"gray\">(needy)</span> is not he who wanders about and whose need is sufficed by a date or two, a bite or two or a meal or two. Rather, the Miskin is he who neither has enough resources to sustain him, all the while people are unaware of his need so they do not give to him, nor does he ask people for anything.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad also recorded this Hadith from Ibn Mas'ud.</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> تَعْرِفُهُم بِسِيمَاهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(You may know them by their mark)</span> means, \"Those who have good minds discover their situation,\" just as Allah said in other instances,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سِيمَاهُمْ فِي وُجُوهِهِم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The mark of them <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. of their faith)</span> is on their faces)</span><span class=\"gray\">[48:29]</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَتَعْرِفَنَّهُمْ فِي لَحْنِ الْقَوْلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But surely, you will know them by the tone of their speech!)</span><span class=\"gray\">[47:30]</span>. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا يَسْأَلُونَ النَّاسَ إِلْحَافًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(they do not beg of people at all)</span> means, they do not beg and, thus, do not require people to provide them with more than what they actually need. Indeed, those who ask people for help, while having what suffices for their needs, have begged.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa'id said, \"My mother sent me to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to ask him for help, but when I came by him I sat down. The Prophet ﷺ faced me and said to me,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنِ اسْتَغْنَى أَغْنَاهُ اللهُ، وَمَنِ اسْتَعَفَّ أَعَفَّهُ اللهُ، وَمَنِ اسْتَكَفَّ كَفَاهُ اللهُ، وَمَنْ سَأَلَ وَلَهُ قِيمَةُ أُوقِيَّةٍ فَقَدْ أَلْـحَفَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever felt satisfied, then Allah will enrich him. Whoever is modest, Allah will make him decent. Whoever is content, then Allah will suffice for him. Whoever asks people, while having a small amout, he will have begged the people.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abu Sa'id said, \"I said to myself, 'I have a camel, Al-Yaqutah, and indeed, it is worth more than a small amount.' And I went back without asking the Prophet ﷺ for anything.\" This is the same wording for this Hadith collected by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i.</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا تُنفِقُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whatever you spend in good, surely Allah knows it well)</span> indicates that no charity escapes Him, and He will reward it fully and perfectly on the Day of Resurrection, when it is most desperately needed.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Praise for those who Spend in Charity</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُم بِاللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ سِرًّا وَعَلَانِيَةً فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who spend their wealth <span class=\"gray\">(in Allah's cause)</span> by night and day, in secret and in public, they shall have their reward with their Lord. On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Ayah praises those who spend in charity for Allah's sake, seeking His pleasure, day and night, publicly and in secret, including what one spends on his family. The Two Sahihs recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّكَ لَنْ تُنْفِقَ نَفَقَةً تَبْتَغِي بِهَا وَجْهَ اللهِ إِلَّا ازْدَدْتَ بِهَا دَرَجَةً وَرِفْعَةً، حَتَّى مَا تَجْعَلُ فِي فِي امْرَأَتِكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(You will not spend charity with which you seek Allah's Face, but you will ascend a higher degree and status because of it, including what you put in your wife's mouth.)</span></p><p lang=\"hmn\" class=\"hmn \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Mas'ud said that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الْمُسْلِمَ إِذَا أَنْفَقَ عَلَى أَهْلِهِ نَفَقَةً يَحْتَسِبُهَا، كَانَتْ لَهُ صَدَقَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When the Muslim spends on his family while awaiting the reward for it from Allah, it will be written as charity for him.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari and Muslim also recorded this Hadith.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(shall have their reward with their Lord)</span>, on the Day of Resurrection, as reward for what they spent in acts of obedience. We previously explained the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(there shall be no fear on them nor shall they grieve.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:38]</span></p>"
