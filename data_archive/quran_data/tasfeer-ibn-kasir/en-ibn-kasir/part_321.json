    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">But <span class=\"gray\">(the hoopoe)</span> stayed not long, he said: \"I have grasped which you have not grasped and I have come to you from Saba' with true news. <span>(22)</span>\"I found a woman ruling over them, she has been given all things, and she has a great throne. <span>(23)</span>\"I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah, and Shaytan has made their deeds fair seeming to them to prevent them from the way, so they have no guidance. <span>(24)</span>So they do not prostrate themselves before Allah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal <span>(25)</span>Allah, La ilaha illa Huwa, the Lord of the Supreme Throne! <span>(26)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>How the Hoopoe came before Sulayman and told Him about Saba'</h2></div><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمَكَثَ غَيْرَ بَعِيدٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But <span class=\"gray\">(the hoopoe)</span> stayed not long,)</span> meaning, he was absent for only a short time. Then he came and said to Sulayman:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَحَطْتُ بِمَا لَمْ تُحِطْ بِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I have grasped which you have not grasped)</span> meaning, 'I have come to know something that you and your troops do not know.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجِئْتُكَ مِنْ سَبَإٍ بِنَبَإٍ يَقِينٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and I have come to you from Saba' with true news.)</span> meaning, with true and certain news. Saba' <span class=\"gray\">(Sheba)</span> refers to Himyar, they were a dynasty in Yemen. Then the hoopoe said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنِّي وَجَدْتُ امْرَأَةً تَمْلِكُهُمْ</p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \"><span class=\"gray\">(I found a woman ruling over them,)</span> Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"This is Bilqis bint Sharahil, the queen of Saba'.\" Allah's saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأُوتِيَتْ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(she has been given all things,)</span> means, all the conveniences of this world that a powerful monarch could need.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَهَا عَرْشٌ عَظِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and she has a great throne.)</span> meaning, a tremendous chair adorned with gold and different kinds of jewels and pearls. The historians said, \"This throne was in a great, strong palace which was high and firmly constructed. In it there were three hundred and sixty windows on the east side, and a similar number on the west, and it was constructed in such a way that each day when the sun rose it would shine through one window, and when it set it would shine through the opposite window. And the people used to prostrate to the sun morning and evening. This is why the hoopoe said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَدْتُهَا وَقَوْمَهَا يَسْجُدُونَ لِلشَّمْسِ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ فَصَدَّهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah, and Shaytan has made their deeds fair seeming to them, and has prevented them from the way,)</span> meaning, from the way of truth,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَهُمْ لَا يَهْتَدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so they have no guidance.)</span> Allah's saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ فَصَدَّهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ فَهُمْ لَا يَهْتَدُونَ - أَلَّا يَسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and Shaytan has made their deeds fair seeming to them, and has prevented them from the way, so they have no guidance, so they do not prostrate themselves before Allah.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">They do not know the way of truth, prostrating only before Allah alone and not before anything that He has created, whether heavenly bodies or anything else. This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ۚ لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And from among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate yourselves not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to Allah Who created them, if you indeed worship Him.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(41:37)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِي يُخْرِجُ الْخَبْءَ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas said: \"He knows everything that is hidden in the heavens and on earth.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This was also the view of 'Ikrimah, Mujahid, Sa'id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and others. His saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُخْفُونَ وَمَا تُعْلِنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and knows what you conceal and what you reveal.)</span> means, He knows what His servants say and do in secret, and what they say and do openly. This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَوَاءٌ مِنْكُمْ مَنْ أَسَرَّ الْقَوْلَ وَمَنْ جَهَرَ بِهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ مُسْتَخْفٍ بِاللَّيْلِ وَسَارِبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is the same whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day)</span><span class=\"gray\">(13:10)</span>. His saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ ۩ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah, La ilaha illa Huwa, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!)</span> means, He is the One to be called upon, Allah, He is the One other than Whom there is no god, the Lord of the Supreme Throne, and there is none greater than Him in all of creation. Since the hoopoe was calling to what is good, and for people to worship and prostrate to Allah alone, it would have been forbidden to kill him. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet ﷺ forbade killing four kinds of animals: ants, bees, hoopoes and the sparrow hawks. Its chain of narration is Sahih.</p>"

It was said that he carried it on his wings, as is the way with birds, or that he carried it in his beak. He went to their land and found the palace of Bilqis, then he went to her private chambers and threw the letter through a small window, then he stepped to one side out of good manners. Bilqis was amazed and confused when she saw that, then she went and picked up the letter, opened its seal and read it. The letter said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّهُ مِنْ سُلَيْمَانَ وَإِنَّهُ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ - أَلَّا تَعْلُوا عَلَيَّ وَأْتُونِي مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(it is from Sulayman, and it <span class=\"gray\">(reads)</span>: 'In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful; Be you not exalted against me, but come to me submitting <span class=\"gray\">(as Muslims)</span>.')</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So she gathered her commanders and ministers and the leaders of her land, and said to them:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> يَا أَيُّهَا الْمَلَأُ إِنِّي أُلْقِيَ إِلَيَّ كِتَابٌ كَرِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"O chiefs! Verily, here is delivered to me a noble letter.\")</span> She described it as such because of the wondrous things she had seen, that it was delivered by a bird who threw it to her, then stood aside out of good manners. This was something that no king could do. Then she read the letter to them:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّهُ مِنْ سُلَيْمَانَ وَإِنَّهُ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ - أَلَّا تَعْلُوا عَلَيَّ وَأْتُونِي مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, it is from Sulayman, and it <span class=\"gray\">(reads)</span>: 'In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful; Be you not exalted against me, but come to me submitting <span class=\"gray\">(as Muslims)</span>.')</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Thus they knew that it was from Allah's Prophet Sulayman, upon him be peace, and that they could not match him. This letter was the utmost in brevity and eloquence, coming straight to the point.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَّا تَعْلُوا عَلَيَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Be you not exalted against me,)</span> Qatadah said: \"Do not be arrogant with me.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأْتُونِي مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but come to me submitting <span class=\"gray\">(as Muslims)</span>.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said: \"Do not refuse or be too arrogant to come to me</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأْتُونِي مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but come to me submitting <span class=\"gray\">(as Muslims)</span>.)</span>\"</p>"
