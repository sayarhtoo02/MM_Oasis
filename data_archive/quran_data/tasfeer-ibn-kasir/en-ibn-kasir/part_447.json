And conceal not the evidence, for he who hides it, surely, his heart is sinful. And Allah is All-Knower of what you do <span>(283)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>What is the 'Mortgaging' Mentioned in the Ayah?</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَإِن كُنتُمْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if you are on a journey)</span> meaning, traveling and some of you borrowed some money to be paid at a later date,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَلَمْ تَجِدُوا كَاتِبًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and cannot find a scribe)</span> who would record the debt for you. Ibn 'Abbas said, \"And even if they find a scribe, but did not find paper, ink or pen.\" Then,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَرِهَانٌ مَّقْبُوضَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(let there be a pledge taken <span class=\"gray\">(mortgaging)</span>)</span> given to the creditor in lieu of writing the transaction. The Two Sahihs recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died while his shield was mortgaged with a Jew in return for thirty Wasq <span class=\"gray\">(approximately 180 kg)</span> of barley, which the Prophet bought on credit as provisions for his household. In another narration, the Hadith stated that this Jew was among the Jews of Al-Madinah.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِنْ أَمِنَ بَعْضُكُم بَعْضًا فَلْيُؤَدِّ الَّذِي اؤْتُمِنَ أَمَانَتَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust <span class=\"gray\">(faithfully)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded, with a sound chain of narration, that Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri said, \"This Ayah abrogated what came before it <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. that which required recording the transaction and having witnesses present)</span>.\" Ash-Sha'bi said, \"If you trust each other, then there is no harm if you do not write the loan or have witnesses present.\" Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلْيَتَّقِ اللَّهَ رَبَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And let him have Taqwa of Allah)</span> means, the debtor.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad and the Sunan recorded that Qatadah said that Al-Hasan said that Samurah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَلَى الْيَدِ مَا أَخَذَتْ، حَتَّى تُؤَدِّيَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The hand <span class=\"gray\">(of the debtor)</span> will carry the burden of what it took until it gives it back.)</span></p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَكْتُمُوا الشَّهَادَةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And conceal not the evidence)</span> means, do not hide it or refuse to announce it. Ibn 'Abbas and other scholars said, \"False testimony is one of the worst of the major sins, and such is the case with hiding the true testimony. This is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">وَمَن يَكْتُمْهَا فَإِنَّهُ آثِمٌ قَلْبُهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(For he who hides it, surely, his heart is sinful)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">As-Suddi commented, \"Meaning he is a sinner in his heart.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا نَكْتُمُ شَهَادَةَ اللَّهِ إِنَّا إِذًا لَّمِنَ الْآثِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We shall not hide testimony of Allah, for then indeed we should be of the sinful)</span><span class=\"gray\">[5:106]</span>.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُونُوا قَوَّامِينَ بِالْقِسْطِ شُهَدَاءَ لِلَّهِ وَلَوْ عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَوِ الْوَالِدَيْنِ وَالْأَقْرَبِينَ إِن يَكُنْ غَنِيًّا أَوْ فَقِيرًا فَاللَّهُ أَوْلَىٰ بِهِمَا فَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا الْهَوَىٰ أَن تَعْدِلُوا وَإِن تَلْوُوا أَوْ تُعْرِضُوا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe!
