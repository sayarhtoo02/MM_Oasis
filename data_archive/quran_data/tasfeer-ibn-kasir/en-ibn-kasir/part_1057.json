When Islam became stronger and widespread, there was no more Fitnah.\" When the man realized that Ibn 'Umar would not agree to what he is saying, he asked him, \"What do you say about 'Ali and 'Uthman?\" Ibn 'Umar replied, \"What do I say about 'Ali and 'Uthman! As for 'Uthman, Allah has forgiven him, but you hate that Allah forgives him. As for 'Ali, he is the cousin of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and his son-in-law,\" and he pointed with his hand saying, \"And this is his house over there.\" Sa'id bin Jubayr said, \"Ibn 'Umar came to us and was asked, \"What do you say about fighting during Fitnah?\" Ibn 'Umar said, \"Do you know what Fitnah refers to? Muhammad ﷺ was fighting against the idolators, and at that time, attending <span class=\"gray\">(or residing with)</span> the idolators was a Fitnah <span class=\"gray\">(trial in religion)</span>. It is nothing like what you are doing, fighting to gain leadership!\" All these narrations were collected by Al-Bukhari, may Allah the Exalted grant him His mercy. Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn 'Abbas said about the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And fight them until there is no more Fitnah...)</span> \"So that there is no more Shirk.\" Similar was said by Abu Al-'Aliyah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi' bin Anas, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Zayd bin Aslam. Muhammad bin Ishaq said that he was informed from Az-Zuhri, from 'Urwah bin Az-Zubayr and other scholars that</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(until there is no more Fitnah)</span> the Fitnah mentioned here means, until no Muslim is persecuted so that he abandons his religion. Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn 'Abbas said about Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ كُلُّهُ لِلَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and the religion <span class=\"gray\">(worship)</span> will all be for Allah alone.)</span> \"So that Tawhid is practiced in sincerity with Allah.\" Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ibn Jurayj said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ كُلُّهُ لِلَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and the religion will all be for Allah alone)</span> \"So that La ilaha illa-llah is proclaimed.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq also commented on this Ayah, \"So that Tawhid is practiced in sincerity towards Allah, without Shirk, all the while shunning all rivals who <span class=\"gray\">(are being worshipped)</span> besides Him.\"</p><p lang=\"ha\" class=\"ha \">Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said about,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ كُلُّهُ لِلَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and the religion will all be for Allah alone)</span> \"So that there is no more Kufr <span class=\"gray\">(disbelief)</span> with your religion remains.\" There is a Hadith collected in the Two Sahihs that testifies to this explanation. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أُقَاتِلَ النَّاسَ، حَتَّى يَقُولُوا: لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، فَإِذَا قَالُوهَا عَصَمُوا مِنِّي دِمَاءَهُمْ وَأَمْوَالَهُمْ، إِلَّا بِحَقِّهَا، وَحِسَابُهُمْ عَلَى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I was commanded to fight against the people until they proclaim, 'There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah.'
