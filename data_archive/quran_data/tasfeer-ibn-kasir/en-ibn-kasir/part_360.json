    "text": "<p class=\"en translation\" lang=\"en\">In their hearts is a disease and Allah has increased their disease. A painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies <span>(10)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Meaning of 'Disease' in this Ayah</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">As-Suddi narrated from Abu Malik and <span class=\"gray\">(also)</span> from Abu Salih, from Ibn 'Abbas, and <span class=\"gray\">(also)</span> Murrah Al-Hamdani from Ibn Mas'ud and other Companions that this Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In their hearts is a disease)</span> means, 'doubt', and,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّهُ مَرَضًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah has increased their disease)</span> also means 'doubt'. Mujahid, 'Ikrimah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Abu Al-'Aliyah, Ar-Rabi' bin Anas and Qatadah also said similarly. 'Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam commented on,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In their hearts is a disease)</span>, \"A disease in the religion, not a physical disease. They are the hypocrites and the disease is the doubt that they brought to Islam.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّهُ مَرَضًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah has increased their disease)</span> meaning, increased them in shameful behavior.\" He also recited,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فَزَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَانًا وَهُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ - وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْسًا إِلَىٰ رِجْسِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(As for those who believe, it has increased their faith, and they rejoice. But as for those in whose hearts is a disease, it will add disgrace to their disgrace.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(9:124-125)</span> and commented, \"Evil to their evil and deviation to their deviation.\" This statement by 'Abdur-Rahman is true, and it constitutes a punishment that is compatible to the sin, just as the earlier scholars stated. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ اهْتَدَوْاْ زَادَهُمْ هُدًى وَءَاتَـــٰـهُمْ تَقُوَاهُمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(While as for those who accept guidance, He increases their guidance and grants them their piety)</span><span class=\"gray\">(47:17)</span>.</p><p lang=\"el-Latn\" class=\"el-Latn \">Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْذِبُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Because they used to tell lies)</span>. The hypocrites have two characteristics, they lie and they deny the Unseen.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The scholars who stated that the Prophet ﷺ knew the hypocrites of his time have only the Hadith of Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman as evidence. In it the Prophet ﷺ gave him the names of fourteen hypocrites during the battle of Tabuk. These hypocrites plotted to assassinate the Prophet ﷺ during the night on a hill in that area. They planned to excite the Prophet's camel, so that she would throw him down the hill. Allah informed the Prophet ﷺ about their plot, and the Prophet ﷺ told Hudhayfah their names.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">As for the other hypocrites, Allah said about them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِمَّنْ حَوْلَكُم مِّنَ الْأَعْرَابِ مُنَافِقُونَ ۖ وَمِنْ أَهْلِ الْمَدِينَةِ ۖ مَرَدُوا عَلَى النِّفَاقِ لَا تَعْلَمُهُمْ ۖ نَحْنُ نَعْلَمُهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And among the bedouins around you, some are hypocrites, and so are some among the people of Al-Madinah who persist in hypocrisy; you <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad ﷺ)</span> know them not, We know them)</span><span class=\"gray\">(9:101)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّئِن لَّمْ يَنتَهِ الْمُنَافِقُونَ وَالَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ وَالْمُرْجِفُونَ فِي الْمَدِينَةِ لَنُغْرِيَنَّكَ بِهِمْ ثُمَّ لَا يُجَاوِرُونَكَ فِيهَا إِلَّا قَلِيلًا - مَّلْعُونِينَ ۖ أَيْنَمَا ثُقِفُوا أُخِذُوا وَقُتِّلُوا تَقْتِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who spread false news among the people in Al-Madinah do not cease, We shall certainly let you overpower them, then they will not be able to stay in it as your neighbors but a little while. Accursed, they shall be seized wherever found, and killed with a <span class=\"gray\">(terrible)</span> slaughter)</span><span class=\"gray\">(33:60-61)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">These Ayat prove that the Prophet ﷺ was not informed about each and everyone among the hypocrites of his time. Rather, the Prophet ﷺ was only informed about their characteristics, and he used to assume that some people possessed these characteristics. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ نَشَاءُ لَأَرَيْنَاكَهُمْ فَلَعَرَفْتَهُم بِسِيمَاهُمْ ۚ وَلَتَعْرِفَنَّهُمْ فِي لَحْنِ الْقَوْلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Had We willed, We could have shown them to you, and you should have known them by their marks; but surely, you will know them by the tone of their speech!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(47:30)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The most notorious hypocrite at that time was 'Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul; Zayd bin Arqam - the Companion - gave truthful testimony to that effect. In addition, 'Umar bin Al-Khattab once mentioned the matter of Ibn Salul to the Prophet ﷺ, who said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنِّي أَكْرَهُ أَنْ تَتَحَدَّثَ الْعَرَبُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا يَقْتُلُ أَصْحَابَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I would not like the Arabs to say to each other that Muhammad ﷺ is killing his Companions.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Yet, when Ibn Salul died, the Prophet ﷺ performed the funeral prayer for him and attended his funeral just as he used to do with other Muslims. It was recorded in the Sahih that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">إِنِّي خُيِّرْتُ فَاخْتَرْتُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I was given the choice <span class=\"gray\">(to pray for him or not)</span>, so I chose.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In another narration, the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَوْ أَعْلَمُ أَنِّي لَوْ زِدْتُ عَلَى السَّبْعِينَ يُغْفَرُ لَهُ لَزِدْتُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If I knew that by asking <span class=\"gray\">(Allah to forgive Ibn Salul)</span> more than seventy times that He would forgive him, then I would do that.)</span></p>"

This is why we were commanded to answer them by saying, 'Wa 'alaykum,' meaning, 'and to you too', then our supplication against them shall be answered, rather than theirs against us.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah forbade the believers from imitating the disbelievers in tongue or deed.

Further, Mujahid said, \"Do not say Ra'ina' means, 'Do not dispute'.\" Mujahid said in another narration, \"Do not say, 'We hear from you, and you hear from us.'\" Also, 'Ata' said, \"Do not say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَاعِنَا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Ra'ina)</span>, which was a dialect that the Ansar used and which was forbidden from use by Allah.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Also, As-Suddi said, \"Rifa'ah bin Zayd, a Jewish man from the tribe of Qaynuqa', used to come to the Prophet ﷺ and say to him, 'Hear, Ghayr Musma'in <span class=\"gray\">(let you hear nothing)</span>.' The Muslims used to think that the Prophets are greeted and honored with this type of speech, and this is why some of them used to say, 'Hear, let you hear nothing,' and so on, as mentioned in Surat An-Nisa.\" Thereafter, Allah forbade the believers from uttering the word Ra'ina.\" 'Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam also said similarly.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The extreme Enmity that the Disbelievers and the People of the Book have against Muslims</h2></div><p lang=\"el-Latn\" class=\"el-Latn \">Allah said next <span class=\"gray\">(2:105)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَّا يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ وَلَا الْمُشْرِكِينَ أَن يُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنْ خَيْرٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Neither those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture <span class=\"gray\">(Jews and Christians)</span> nor Al-Mushrikin <span class=\"gray\">(the idolaters)</span>, like that there should be sent down unto you any good from your Lord)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah described the deep enmity that the disbelieving polytheists and People of the Scripture, whom Allah warned against imitating, have against the believers, so that Muslims should sever all friendship with them.
