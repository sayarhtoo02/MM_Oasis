When the sun goes down, the Hilal is visible.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا جَلَّاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By the day as it Jallaha.)</span> Mujahid said, \"When it illuminates.\" Thus, Mujahid said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا جَلَّاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By the day as it Jallaha.)</span> \"This is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By the day as it Tajalla.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(92:2)</span>\" And they have said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By the night as it Yaghshaha.)</span> meaning, when it covers the sun, which takes place when sun disappears and the horizons become dark.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالسَّمَاءِ وَمَا بَنَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By the heaven and Ma Banaha.)</span> The meaning here could be for descriptive purposes, meaning \"By the heaven and its construction.\" This was said by Qatadah. It could also mean \"By the heaven and its Constructor.\" This was stated by Mujahid. Both views are interrelated, and construction means raising. This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالسَّمَاءَ بَنَيْنَاهَا بِأَيْدٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(With Hands did We construct the heaven.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(51:47)</span> meaning, with strength.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ - وَالْأَرْضَ فَرَشْنَاهَا فَنِعْمَ الْمَاهِدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, We are able to extend the vastness of space thereof.

This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفًا ۚ فِطْرَتَ اللَّهِ الَّتِي فَطَرَ النَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا ۚ لَا تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So set you your face towards the religion, Hanif. Allah's Fitrah with which He has created mankind. No change let there be in the Khalqillah.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(30:30)</span></p><p lang=\"no\" class=\"no \">The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلى الْفِطْرَةِ فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ أَوْ يُنَصِّرَانِهِ أَوْ يُمَجِّسَانِهِ، كَمَا تُولَدُ الْبَهِيمَةُ بَهِيمَةً جَمْعَاءَ، هَلْ تُحِسُّونَ فِيهَا مِنْ جَدْعَاءَ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Every child that is born, is born upon the Fitrah, but his parents make him a Jew, a Christian, or a Zoroastrian. This is just as the animal is born, complete with all of its parts. Do you notice any mutilation in it?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this Hadith from Abu Hurayrah. In Sahih Muslim, it has been narrated from 'Iyad bin Himar Al-Mujashi'i that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَقُولُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: إِنِّي خَلَقْتُ عِبَادِي حُنَفَاءَ فَجَاءَتْهُمُ الشَّيَاطِينُ فَاجْتَالَتْهُمْ عَنْ دِينِهِم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah the Mighty and Majestic says, \"Verily I created My servants Hunafa' <span class=\"gray\">(as monotheists)</span>, but then the devils came to them and distracted them from their religion.)</span>\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then He showed it its Fujur and its Taqwa.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, He showed him to his transgression and his Taqwa. This means that He clarified that for it and He guided it to what has been ordained for him. Ibn 'Abbas said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then He showed it its Fujur and its Taqwa.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"He explained the good and the evil to it <span class=\"gray\">(the soul)</span>.\" Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ath-Thawri all said the same. Sa'id bin Jubayr said, \"He gave him inspiration <span class=\"gray\">(to see what was)</span> good and evil.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"He made its Fujur and its Taqwa inside of it.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Jarir recorded from Abul-Aswad Ad-Dili that he said, \"'Imran bin Husayn said to me, 'Do you think that what the people do, and what they strive for is a thing that is pre-ordained and predestined for them, or is it a thing which is only written after the Message comes to them from the Prophet ﷺ, when there will be an evidence against them?' I said, 'Rather it is something preordained upon them.' Then he said, 'Is that an injustice?' Then I became extremely frightened of him <span class=\"gray\">(due to what he was saying)</span>, and I said to him, 'There is nothing except that He <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span> created it and possesses it in His Hand. He is not asked about what He does, while they <span class=\"gray\">(His creation)</span> will be asked.' He <span class=\"gray\">('Imran)</span> then said, 'May Allah guide you! I only asked you about that in order to inform you that a man from Muzaynah or Juhaynah tribe came to the Allah's Messenger ﷺ and asked him:</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"O Messenger of Allah! Do you consider the actions of mankind and their struggles to be preordained for them and written for them from Qadr, or something written for them only after the Message came to them from their Prophet, when there will be an evidence against them?\" He <span class=\"gray\">(the Prophet ﷺ)</span> replied:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَلْ شَيْءٌ قَدْ قُضِيَ عَلَيْهِم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Rather it is something preordained for them.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So the man said, \"Then what is the point of our actions?\" The Prophet ﷺ replied,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ كَانَ اللهُ خَلَقَهُ لإِحْدَى الْمَنْزِلَتَيْنِ يُهَيِّئُهُ لَهَا، وَتَصْدِيقُ ذَلِكَ فِي كِتَابِ اللهِ تَعَالَى:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَنَفْسٍ وَمَا سَوَّاهَا - فَأَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever Allah created for one of the two positions <span class=\"gray\">(Paradise or Hell)</span>, He makes it easy for him <span class=\"gray\">(to attain)</span>. The proof of that is in the Book of Allah <span class=\"gray\">(By Nafs, and Ma Sawwaha <span class=\"gray\">(Who apportioned it)</span>. Then He showed it its Fujur and its Taqwa)</span>.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ahmad and Muslim both recorded this Hadith. Allah then says,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّاهَا - وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّاهَا</p><p lang=\"haw\" class=\"haw \"><span class=\"gray\">(Indeed he succeeds who purifies it. And indeed he fails who Dassaha.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This could mean that whoever purifies himself by obedience to Allah, then he will be successful. This is as Qatadah said, \"He cleanses it from the lowly and despicable characteristics.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Similar to this has been reported from Mujahid, 'Ikrimah and Sa'id bin Jubayr.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And indeed he fails who Dassaha.)</span> meaning, to conceal it. This means that he makes it dull, and he disregards it by neglecting to allow it to receive guidance. He treats it in this manner until he performs acts of disobedience and he abandons obedience of Allah. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It also could mean that he is indeed successful whose soul Allah purifies, and he has failed whose soul Allah corrupts. This is like what was reported by Al-'Awfi and 'Ali bin Abi Talhah from Ibn 'Abbas. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">At-Tabarani recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to stop whenever he recited this Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَنَفْسٍ وَمَا سَوَّاهَا - فَأَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By Nafs, and Ma Sawwaha <span class=\"gray\">(Who apportioned it)</span>. Then He showed it its Fujur and its Taqwa.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then he would say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللّٰهُمَّ آتِ نَفْسِي تَقْوَاهَا، أَنْتَ وَلِيُّهَا وَمَوْلَاهَا، وَخَيْرُ مَنْ زَكَّاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Allah! Give my soul its good. You are its Guardian and Master, and the best to purify it.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Another Hadith</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Zayd bin Arqam said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْعَجْز وَالْكَسَلِ، وَالْهَرَمِ وَالْجُبْنِ وَالْبُخْلِ وَعَذَابِ الْقَبْرِ. اللّٰهُمَّ آتِ نَفْسِي تَقْوَاهَا، وَزَكِّهَا أَنْتَ خَيْرُ مَنْ زَكَّاهَا، أَنْتَ وَلِيُّهَا وَمَوْلَاهَا. اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ قَلْبٍ لَا يَخْشَعُ، وَمِنْ نَفْسٍ لَا تَشْبَعُ، وَعِلْمٍ لَا يَنْفَعُ، وَدَعْوَةٍ لَا يُسْتَجَابُ لَهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Allah! Verily, I seek refuge with You from weakness, laziness, senility <span class=\"gray\">(of old age)</span>, cowardliness, stinginess and the torment of the grave. O Allah! Give my soul its good and purify it, for You are the best to purify it. You are its Guardian and Master. O Allah! Verily, I seek refuge with You from a heart that is not humble, a soul that is not satisfied, knowledge that does not benefit and a supplication that is not answered.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Zayd then said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to teach us these <span class=\"gray\">(words)</span> and we now teach them to you.\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith.</p>"
