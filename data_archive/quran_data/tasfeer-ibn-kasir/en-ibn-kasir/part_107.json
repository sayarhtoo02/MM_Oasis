    "text": "<p class=\"en translation\" lang=\"en\">And indeed, We have bestowed upon you seven of the Mathani, and the Grand Qur'an <span>(87)</span>Look not with your eyes ambitiously at what We have given to certain classes of them, nor grieve over them. And lower your wings to the believers <span>(88)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>A Reminder of the Blessing of the Qur'an and the Command to focus on its Message</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah is saying to His Prophet ﷺ: Since We have given you the Grand Qur'an, then do not look at this world and its attractions, or the transient delights that we have given to its people in order to test them. Do not envy what they have in this world, and do not upset yourself with regret for their rejection of you and their opposition to your religion.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاخْفِضْ جَنَاحَكَ لِمَنِ اتَّبَعَكَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And lower your wings to the believers who follow you)</span><span class=\"gray\">(26:215)</span> meaning - be gentle with them, like the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from among yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He is anxious for you, for the believers - he is full of pity, kind and merciful)</span><span class=\"gray\">(9:128)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There were some differences among the scholars over the meaning of \"seven of the Mathani\". Ibn Mas'ud, Ibn 'Umar, Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, Sa'id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and others said that they are the seven long <span class=\"gray\">(Surahs)</span>, meaning Al-Baqarah, Āl-'Imrān, An-Nisa', Al-Ma'idah, Al-An'am, Al-A'raf and Yunus. There are texts to this effect reported from Ibn 'Abbas and Sa'id bin Jubayr. Sa'id said: \"In them, Allah explains the obligations, the Hudud <span class=\"gray\">(legal limits)</span>, stories and rulings.\" Ibn 'Abbas said, \"He explains the parables, stories and lessons.\" The second opinion is that they <span class=\"gray\">(the seven of the Mathani)</span> are Al-Fatihah, which is composed of seven Ayat. This was reported from 'Ali, 'Umar, Ibn Mas'ud and Ibn 'Abbas. Ibn 'Abbas said: \"The Bismillah, is completing seven Ayah, which Allah has given exclusively to you <span class=\"gray\">(Muslims)</span>.\" This is also the opinion of Ibrahim An-Nakha'i, 'Abdullah bin 'Umayr, Ibn Abi Mulaykah, Shahr bin Hawshab, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and Mujahid.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded two Hadiths on this topic. <span class=\"gray\">(The first)</span> was recorded from Abu Sa'id bin Al-Mu'alla, who said: \"The Prophet ﷺ passed by me while I was praying. He called out for me but I did not come until I finished my prayer. Then I came to him, and He asked,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا مَنَعَكَ أَنْ تَأْتِيَنِي؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(What stopped you from coming to me?)</span> I said, 'I was praying'. He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَمْ يَقُلِ اللهُ </p><p lang=\"fil\" class=\"fil \"><span class=\"gray\">('Did not Allah say</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اسْتَجِيبُوا لِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ إِذَا دَعَاكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe!

As Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللَّهُ نَزَّلَ أَحْسَنَ الْحَدِيثِ كِتَابًا مُّتَشَابِهًا مَّثَانِيَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah has sent down the best statement, a Book <span class=\"gray\">(this Qur'an)</span>, its parts resembling each other in goodness and truth, oft-recited)</span><span class=\"gray\">(39:23)</span>. So it is oft-recited in one way, and its parts resemble one another in another way, and this is also the Grand Qur'an.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لاَ تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ إِلَى مَا مَتَّعْنَا بِهِ أَزْوَاجًا مِّنْهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Look not with your eyes ambitiously at what We have given to certain classes of them)</span><span class=\"gray\">[20:131]</span> meaning, be content with the Grand Qur'an that Allah has given to you, and do not long for the luxuries and transient delights that they have.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا تَمُدَّنَّ عَيْنَيْكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Look not with your eyes ambitiously)</span> Al-'Awfi reported that Ibn 'Abbas said: \"He <span class=\"gray\">[in this Ayah]</span> forbade a man to wish for what his companion has.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِلَىٰ مَا مَتَّعْنَا بِهِ أَزْوَاجًا مِّنْهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(at what We have given to certain classes of them,)</span> Mujahid said: \"This refers to the rich.\"</p>"
