    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And when he came to it <span class=\"gray\">(the fire)</span>, he was called by name: \"O Musa! <span>(11)</span>\"Verily, I am your Lord! So take off your shoes; you are in the sacred valley, Tuwa. <span>(12)</span>\"And I have chosen you. So listen to that which will be revealed <span class=\"gray\">(to you)</span><span>(13)</span>\"Verily, I am Allah! There is no God but Me, so worship Me, and perform Salah for My remembrance. <span>(14)</span>\"Verily, the Hour is coming – and I am almost hiding it – that every person may be rewarded for that which he strives. <span>(15)</span>\"Therefore, let not the one who believes not therein, but follows his own lusts, divert you therefrom, lest you perish. <span>(16)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The First Revelation to Musa</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah, the Exalted, says,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">فَلَمَّا أَتَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when he came to it,)</span> This is referring to the fire when he approached it.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">نُودِيَ يَا مُوسَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He was called by name: \"O Musa!\")</span> In another Ayah it says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نُودِيَ مِن شَاطِئِ الْوَادِ الْأَيْمَنِ فِي الْبُقْعَةِ الْمُبَارَكَةِ مِنَ الشَّجَرَةِ أَن يَا مُوسَىٰ إِنِّي أَنَا اللَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place, from the tree: \"O Musa! Verily, I am Allah.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[28:30]</span> However, here Allah says,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">إِنِّي أَنَا رَبُّكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, I am your Lord!)</span> meaning, 'the One Who is talking to you and addressing you,'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَاخْلَعْ نَعْلَيْكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So take off your shoes;)</span> 'Ali bin Abi Talib, Abu Dharr, Abu Ayyub and others of the Salaf said, \"They <span class=\"gray\">(his sandals)</span> were from the skin of a donkey that was not slaughtered.\" It has also been said that he was only commanded to remove his sandals due to respect for the blessed spot. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">طُوًى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Tuwa)</span> 'Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"It is the name of the valley.\" Others have said the same. This is merely mentioned as something to give more explanation to the story. It has also been said that it is a figure of speech, which comes from the command to place his feet down. It has also been said that it means 'doubly sacred' and that Tuwa is something that has repetitious blessings. However, the first opinion is most correct. It is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذْ نَادَاهُ رَبُّهُ بِالْوَادِ الْمُقَدَّسِ طُوًى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When his Lord called him in the sacred valley of Tuwa.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[79:16]</span> Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">وَأَنَا اخْتَرْتُكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And I have chosen you.)</span> is similar to His statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنِّي اصْطَفَيْتُكَ عَلَى النَّاسِ بِرِسَالَاتِي وَبِكَلَامِي </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I have chosen you above men by My Messages, and by My speaking <span class=\"gray\">(to you)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[7:144]</span> This means over all human beings of that time. It has also been said that Allah said, \"O Musa, do you know why I chose to speak to you directly out of all of the people?\" Musa said, \"No.\" Allah then said, \"Because I have not made anyone humble himself as much as you have humbled yourself. \" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَاسْتَمِعْ لِمَا يُوحَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So listen to that which will be revealed.)</span> \"Now listen to what I say to you and what I reveal to you.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّنِي أَنَا اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, I am Allah! There is no God but Me,)</span> This is the first obligation upon all responsible people of age, that they know that there is no God worthy of worship except Allah alone, Who has no partners. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">فَاعْبُدْنِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so worship Me,)</span> This means, \"Single Me out alone for worship, and establish My worship without associating anything with Me.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ لِذِكْرِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and perform Salah for My remembrance.)</span> It has been said that this means, \"Pray in order to remember Me.\" It has also been said that it means, \"And establish the prayer whenever you remember Me.\" There is a supporting evidence for this second statement in a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad from Anas, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا رَقَدَ أَحَدُكُمْ عَنِ الصَّلَاةِ أَوْ غَفَلَ عَنْهَا، فَلْيُصَلِّهَا إِذَا ذَكَرَهَا، فَإِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالى قَالَ:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ لِذِكْرِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whenever one of you sleeps past the prayer, or he forgets to pray, then let him pray when he remembers it. For verily, Allah said, <span class=\"gray\">(And perform Salah for My remembrance.)</span>)</span> In the Two Sahihs it is reported from Anas that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ نَامَ عَنْ صَلَاةٍ أَوْ نَسِيَهَا فَكَفَّارَتُهَا أَنْ يُصَلِّيَهَا إِذَا ذَكَرَهَا، لَا كَفَّارَةَ لهَا إِلَّا ذَلِكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever slept past the prayer, or forgot it, then his expiation is that he prays it when he remembers it. There is no expiation for it other than that.)</span> Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ السَّاعَةَ آتِيَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the Hour is coming)</span> This means that it is established and there is no avoiding it. It will be and it is inevitable. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">أَكَادُ أُخْفِيهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I am almost hiding it)</span> Ad-Dahhak related from Ibn 'Abbas that he used to recite it as, \"I almost kept it hidden – from myself.\" Ibn 'Abbas then would say, \"Because nothing is ever hidden from Allah's Self.\" 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn 'Abbas that he said,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">أَكَادُ أُخْفِيهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I am almost hiding it.)</span> \"This means that no one knows its appointed time except Me <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span>.\" Allah also said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثَقُلَتْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ لَا تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلَّا بَغْتَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[7:187]</span> This means that its knowledge weighs heavily upon the dwellers of the heavens and the earth. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِتُجْزَىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا تَسْعَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that every person may be rewarded for that which he strives.)</span> \"I will establish it and it is inevitable. I will certainly reward every person who does something, according to what he did.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُ - وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom shall see it.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(99:7-8)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(You are only being requited for what you used to do.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[52:16]</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا يَصُدَّنَّكَ عَنْهَا مَن لَّا يُؤْمِنُ بِهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Therefore, let not divert you the one who believes not therein,)</span> The address here is directed towards all individuals who are responsible <span class=\"gray\">(and capable of taking heed to this message)</span>. This means, \"Do not follow the way of the person who does not believe in the Hour <span class=\"gray\">(Day of Judgement)</span> and he only pursues his desires in this worldly life. He disobeys his Lord and only follows his desires. Whoever behaves like these people, then verily he has failed and lost.</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">فَتَرْدَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(lest you perish.)</span> This means that you will be destroyed and ruined.</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">وَمَا يُغْنِي عَنْهُ مَالُهُ إِذَا تَرَدَّىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And what will his wealth avail him when he goes down <span class=\"gray\">(in destruction)</span>?)</span><span class=\"gray\">[92:11]</span></p>"
