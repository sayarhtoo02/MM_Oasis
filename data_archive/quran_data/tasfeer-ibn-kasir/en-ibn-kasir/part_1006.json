    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"And O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in Paradise, and eat thereof as you both wish, but approach not this tree otherwise you both will be of the wrongdoers <span>(19)</span>Then Shaytan whispered suggestions to them both in order to uncover that which was hidden from them of their private parts <span class=\"gray\">(before)</span>; he said: \"Your Lord did not forbid you this tree save you should become angels or become of the immortals. <span>(20)</span>And he 'Qāsamahuma': \"Verily, I am one of the sincere well-wishers for you both. <span>(21)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Shaytan's Deceit with Adam and Hawwa' and Their eating from the Forbidden Tree</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah states that He allowed Adam and his wife to dwell in Paradise and to eat from all of its fruits, except one tree. We have already discussed this in Surat Al-Baqarah. Thus, Shaytan envied them and plotted deceitfully, whispering and suggesting treachery. He wished to rid them of the various favors and nice clothes that they were enjoying.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالَ</p><p lang=\"af\" class=\"af \"><span class=\"gray\">(He <span class=\"gray\">(Shaytan)</span> said)</span> uttering lies and falsehood,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا نَهَاكُمَا رَبُّكُمَا عَنْ هَٰذِهِ الشَّجَرَةِ إِلَّا أَن تَكُونَا مَلَكَيْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Your Lord did not forbid you this tree save you should become angels...\")</span> meaning, so that you do not become angels or dwell here for eternity. Surely, if you eat from this tree, you will attain both, he said. In another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ يَا آدَمُ هَلْ أَدُلُّكَ عَلَىٰ شَجَرَةِ الْخُلْدِ وَمُلْكٍ لَّا يَبْلَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Shaytan whispered to him, saying: \"O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away?\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[20:120]</span>. Here, the wording is similar, so it means, 'so that you do not become angels' as in;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ أَن تَضِلُّوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(Thus)</span> does Allah make clear to you <span class=\"gray\">(His Law)</span> lest you go astray.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[4:176]</span> meaning, so that you do not go astray, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَلْقَىٰ فِي الْأَرْضِ رَوَاسِيَ أَن تَمِيدَ بِكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He has affixed into the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with you;)</span><span class=\"gray\">[16:15]</span> that is, so that the earth does not shake with you.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَاسَمَهُمَا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And he 'Qāsamahuma')</span>, swore to them both by Allah, saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنِّي لَكُمَا لَمِنَ النَّاصِحِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Verily, I am one of the sincere well-wishers for you both.\")</span> for I was here before you and thus have better knowledge of this place. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It is a fact that the believer in Allah might sometimes become the victim of deceit. Qatadah commented on this Ayah, \"Shaytan swore by Allah, saying, 'I was created before you, and I have better knowledge than you. Therefore, follow me and I will direct you.'\"</p>"
