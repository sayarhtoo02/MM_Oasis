Allah, Worthy of all praise, then encourages them to turn to Him in repentance.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah is Forgiving, Most Merciful.)</span> It was reported that this Ayah was revealed about Al-Aqra' bin Habis At-Tamimi, may Allah be pleased with him, according to more than one source. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Aqra' bin Habis said that he called the Messenger of Allah ﷺ from behind his dwellings, saying, \"O Muhammad! O Muhammad!\" \"O Allah's Messenger!\" according to another narration, but the Messenger ﷺ did not answer him, Al-Aqra' said, \"O Allah's Messenger.My praise <span class=\"gray\">(of others)</span> is worthwhile and my admonishment <span class=\"gray\">(of others)</span> is degrading.\" The Prophet ﷺ replied,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَاكَ اللّٰه عزَّ وَجَلَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is Allah the Exalted <span class=\"gray\">(Who is worthy of this description)</span>.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنْ جَاءَكُمْ فَاسِقٌ بِنَبَإٍ فَتَبَيَّنُوا أَنْ تُصِيبُوا قَوْمًا بِجَهَالَةٍ فَتُصْبِحُوا عَلَىٰ مَا فَعَلْتُمْ نَادِمِينَ - وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ فِيكُمْ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ۚ لَوْ يُطِيعُكُمْ فِي كَثِيرٍ مِنَ الْأَمْرِ لَعَنِتُّمْ وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ حَبَّبَ إِلَيْكُمُ الْإِيمَانَ وَزَيَّنَهُ فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ وَكَرَّهَ إِلَيْكُمُ الْكُفْرَ وَالْفُسُوقَ وَالْعِصْيَانَ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الرَّاشِدُونَ - فَضْلًا مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَنِعْمَةً ۚ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(6.

And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Investigating the Reliability of the News conveyed by Wicked People</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah the Exalted ordered investigating the news that sinners and the wicked bring, to make sure of its authenticity. Otherwise, if the sinner's word is taken for granted and a decision is based on it, regardless of whether the information is true or not, the authorities will be taking the lead of the sinners. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored forbade taking the path of the corrupted and sinners. This is why groups of the scholars of Hadith refuse to accept narrations from narrators whose reliability is unknown, for they might be from among the wicked people, in reality.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Prophet's Decision is Better</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ فِيكُمْ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(7. And know that among you there is the Messenger of Allah.)</span> 'know that among you is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Therefore, honor and respect him, be polite with him and obey his orders. For he is more knowledgeable about what benefits you and is more concerned with you than you yourselves are. His opinions in such matters are more complete than your own.' Allah the Exalted and Most Blessed said in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">النَّبِيُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Prophet is closer to the believers than themselves)</span><span class=\"gray\">(33:6)</span>. Then He clarifies that they fall short in overseeing their own benefit;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَوْ يُطِيعُكُمْ فِي كَثِيرٍ مِنَ الْأَمْرِ لَعَنِتُّمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If he were to obey you in much of the matter, you would surely be in trouble.)</span> 'if he obeys all of your opinions and desires, you will earn trouble and hardship.' Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوِ اتَّبَعَ الْحَقُّ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ لَفَسَدَتِ السَّمَاوَاتُ وَالْأَرْضُ وَمَنْ فِيهِنَّ ۚ بَلْ أَتَيْنَاهُمْ بِذِكْرِهِمْ فَهُمْ عَنْ ذِكْرِهِمْ مُعْرِضُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if the truth had been in accordance with their desires, verily, the heavens and the earth, and whosoever is therein would have been corrupted! Nay, We have brought them their reminder, but they turn away from their reminder.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(23:71)</span> Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ حَبَّبَ إِلَيْكُمُ الْإِيمَانَ وَزَيَّنَهُ فِي قُلُوبِكُمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But Allah has endeared the faith to you and has beautified it in your hearts,)</span> 'made faith dear to your souls and beautified it in your hearts.' Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَرَّهَ إِلَيْكُمُ الْكُفْرَ وَالْفُسُوقَ وَالْعِصْيَانَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and has made disbelief, Fusuq and 'Isyan hateful to you.)</span> 'He has made disbelief, sins, whether major or minor, and 'Isyan – all types of sins, hateful to you.' This statement transfers us from one level to a better level, to perfect Allah's bounty. Allah's statement next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الرَّاشِدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Such are they who are the rightly guided.)</span> those who have these qualities are the rightly guided ones whom Allah has granted guidance and correctness.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Rifa'ah Az-Zuraqi said that his father said, \"During the battle of Uhud, when the idolators retreated, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اسْتَوُوا حَتّٰى أُثْنِيَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّي عَزَّ وَجَلَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Stay in straight lines so that I praise my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored.)</span> They stood behind him in lines and he ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللّٰهُمَّ لَكَ الْحَمْدُ كُلُّهُ، اللّٰهُمَّ لَا قَابِضَ لِمَا بَسَطْتَ وَلَا بَاسِطَ لِمَا قَبَضْتَ، وَلَا هَادِيَ لِمَنْ أَضْلَلْتَ، وَلَا مُضِلَّ لِمَنْ هَدَيْتَ، وَلَا مُعْطِيَ لِمَا مَنَعْتَ وَلَا مَانِعَ لِمَا أَعْطَيْتَ، وَلَا مُقَرِّبَ لِمَا بَاعَدْتَ، وَلَا مُبَاعِدَ لِمَا قَرَّبْتَ. اللّٰهُمَّ ابْسُطْ عَلَيْنَا مِنْ بَرَكَاتِكَ وَرَحْمَتِكَ وَفَضْلِكَ وَرِزْقِكَ، اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ النَّعِيمَ الْمُقِيمَ الَّذِي لَا يَحُولُ وَلَا يَزُولُ. اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ النَّعِيمَ يَوْمَ الْعَيْلَةِ وَالْأَمْنَ يَوْمَ الْخَوْفِ. اللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّي عَائِذٌ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا أَعْطَيْتَنَا وَمِنْ شَرِّ مَا مَنَعْتَنَا. اللّٰهُمَّ حَبِّبْ إِلَيْنَا الْإيمَانَ وَزَيِّنْهُ فِي قُلُوبِنَا وَكَرِّهْ إِلَيْنَا الْكُفْرَ وَالْفُسُوقَ وَالْعِصْيَانَ وَاجْعَلْنَا مِنَ الرَّاشِدِينَ. اللّٰهُمَّ تَوَفَّنَا مُسْلِمِينَ وَأَحْيِنَا مُسْلِمِينَ وَأَلْحِقْنَا بِالصَّالِحِينَ غَيْرَ خَزَايَا وَلَا مَفْتُونِينَ، اللّٰهُمَّ قَاتِلِ الْكَفَرَةَ الَّذِينَ يُكَذِّبُونَ رُسُلَكَ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَنْ سَبِيلِكَ وَاجْعَلْ عَلَيْهِمْ رِجْزَكَ وَعَذَابَكَ، اللّٰهُمَّ قَاتِلِ الْكَفَرَةَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ إِلٰهَ الْحَقِّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Allah!
