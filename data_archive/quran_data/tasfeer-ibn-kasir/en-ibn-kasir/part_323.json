So, she sent word to him saying: \"I am coming to you with the leaders of my people to see what you will instruct us to do and what you are calling us to of your religion.\" Then she issued commands that her throne, which was made of gold and inlaid with rubies, chrysolite and pearls, should be placed in the innermost of seven rooms, one within the other, and all the doors should be locked. Then she told her deputy whom she was leaving in charge, \"Take care of my people and my throne, and do not let anyone approach it or see it until I come back to you.\" Then she set off to meet Sulayman with twelve thousand of her commanders from the leaders of Yemen, under each of whose command were many thousands of men. Sulayman sent the Jinn to bring him news of her progress and route every day and night, then when she drew near, he gathered together the Jinns and humans who were under his control and said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الْمَلَأُ أَيُّكُمْ يَأْتِينِي بِعَرْشِهَا قَبْلَ أَنْ يَأْتُونِي مُسْلِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O chiefs! Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me surrendering themselves in obedience <span class=\"gray\">(as Muslims)</span>?)</span>.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ عِفْرِيتٌ مِنَ الْجِنِّ</p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \"><span class=\"gray\">(An 'Ifrit from the Jinn said: )</span> Mujahid said, \"A giant Jinn.\" Abu Salih said, \"It was as if he was a mountain.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنَا آتِيكَ بِهِ قَبْلَ أَنْ تَقُومَ مِنْ مَقَامِكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I will bring it to you before you rise from your place.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"Before you get up from where you are sitting.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">As-Suddi and others said: \"He used to sit to pass judgements and rulings over the people, and to eat, from the beginning of the day until noon.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنِّي عَلَيْهِ لَقَوِيٌّ أَمِينٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, I am indeed strong and trustworthy for such work.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas said: \"Strong enough to carry it and trustworthy with the jewels it contains. Sulayman, upon him be peace, said, \"I want it faster than that.\" From this it seems that Sulayman wanted to bring this throne as a demonstration of the greatness of the power and authority that Allah had bestowed upon him and the troops that He had subjugated to him. Power such as had never been given to anyone else, before or since, so that this would furnish proof of his prophethood before Bilqis and her people, because this would be a great and wondrous thing, if he brought her throne as if he were in her country, before they could come to it, although it was hidden and protected by so many locked doors. When Sulayman said, \"I want it faster than that,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ الَّذِي عِنْدَهُ عِلْمٌ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: )</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas said, \"This was Asif, the scribe of Sulayman.\" It was also narrated by Muhammad bin Ishaq from Yazid bin Ruman that he was Asif bin Barkhiya' and he was a truthful believer who knew the Greatest Name of Allah. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Qatadah said: \"He was a believer among the humans, and his name was Asif.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنَا آتِيكَ بِهِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَرْتَدَّ إِلَيْكَ طَرْفُكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Meaning, lift your gaze and look as far as you can, and before you get tired and blink, you will find it before you. Then he got up, performed ablution and prayed to Allah, may He be exalted. Mujahid said: \"He said, O Owner of majesty and honor.\" When Sulayman and his chiefs saw it before them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ هَٰذَا مِنْ فَضْلِ رَبِّي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(he said: \"This is by the grace of my Lord...\")</span> meaning, 'this is one of the blessings which Allah has bestowed upon me.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِيَبْلُوَنِي أَأَشْكُرُ أَمْ أَكْفُرُ ۖ وَمَنْ شَكَرَ فَإِنَّمَا يَشْكُرُ لِنَفْسِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(to test whether I am grateful or ungrateful! And whoever is grateful, truly, his gratitude is for himself;)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is like the Ayat:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحًا فَلِنَفْسِهِ ۖ وَمَنْ أَسَاءَ فَعَلَيْهَا ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whosoever does righteous good deed, it is for himself; and whosoever does evil, it is against himself.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(41:46)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحًا فَلِأَنْفُسِهِمْ يَمْهَدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and whosoever does righteous good deed, then such will prepare a good place for themselves.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(30:44)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَمَنْ كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ رَبِّي غَنِيٌّ كَرِيمٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and whoever is ungrateful, certainly my Lord is Rich, Bountiful.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He has no need of His servants or their worship.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَرِيمٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Bountiful)</span> He is Bountiful in and of Himself, even if no one were to worship Him. His greatness does not depend on anyone. This is like what Musa said: p</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنْ تَكْفُرُوا أَنْتُمْ وَمَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If you disbelieve, you and all on earth together, then verily, Allah is Rich, Owner of all praise.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(14:8)</span>. </p><p lang=\"af\" class=\"af \">It is recorded in Sahih Muslim:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: يَا عِبَادِي لَوْ أَنَّ أَوَّلَكُمْ وَآخِرَكُمْ وَإِنْسَكُمْ وَجِنَّكُمْ كَانُوا عَلَى أَتْقَى قَلْبِ رَجُلٍ مِنْكُمْ مَا زَادَ ذَلِكَ فِي مُلْكِي شَيْئًا. يَا عِبَادِي لَوْ أَنَّ أَوَّلَكُمْ وَآخِرَكُمْ وَإِنْسَكُمْ وَجِنَّكُمْ كَانُوا عَلَى أَفْجَرِ قَلْبِ رَجُلٍ مِنْكُمْ مَا نَقَصَ ذَلِكَ مِنْ مُلْكِي شَيْئًا. يَا عِبَادِي إِنَّمَا هِيَ أَعْمَالُكُمْ أُحْصِيهَا لَكُمْ ثُمَّ أُوَفِّيكُمْ إِيَّاهَا فَمَنْ وَجَدَ خَيْرًا فَلْيَحْمَدِ اللهَ،وَمَنْ وَجَدَ غَيْرَ ذَلِكَ فَلَا يَلُومَنَّ إِلَّا نَفْسَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah, may He be exalted, says: \"O My servants, if the first of you and the last of you, mankind and Jinn alike, were all to be as pious as the most pious among you, that would not add to My dominion in the slightest.

O My servants, these are deeds which I am recording for you, and I will judge you according to them, so whoever finds something good, let him praise Allah, and whoever finds otherwise, let him blame no one but himself.\")</span></p>"
