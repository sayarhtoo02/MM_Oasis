It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Ibn Mas'ud said, \"I asked the Prophet ﷺ, 'Which deed is the dearest <span class=\"gray\">(to Allah)</span>?' He replied:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الصَّلَاةُ عَلى وَقْتِها</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(To offer the prayers at their fixed times.)</span> I asked, 'What is the next <span class=\"gray\">(in goodness)</span>?' He replied:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(To participate in Jihad <span class=\"gray\">(religious fighting)</span> in Allah's cause.)</span>\" I again asked, 'What is the next <span class=\"gray\">(in goodness)</span>?' He replied:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِرُّ الْوَالِدَيْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(To be good and dutiful to your parents.)</span> 'Abdullah then added, \"The Prophet ﷺ told me these words, and had I asked more, the Prophet ﷺ would have told me more.\"</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Middle Prayer</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Furthermore, Allah has specifically mentioned the Middle prayer, which is the 'Asr prayer according to the majority of the scholars among the Companions, as At-Tirmidhi and Al-Baghawi have stated. Al-Qadi Al-Mawardi added that the majority of the scholars of the Tabi'in also held this view. Al-Hafiz Abu 'Umar bin 'Abdul-Barr said that this is also the opinion of the majority of the scholars of the Athar <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., the Hadith and the statements of the Salaf)</span>.</p><p lang=\"ha\" class=\"ha \">In addition, Abu Muhammad bin 'Atiyah said that this is the Tafsir <span class=\"gray\">(of the Middle prayer)</span> of the majority of scholars. Al-Hafiz Abu Muhammad 'Abdul-Mu'min bin Khalaf Ad-Dumyati stated in his book on the Middle prayer that it is the 'Asr prayer and mentioned that this is the Tafsir of 'Umar, 'Ali, Ibn Mas'ud, Abu Ayyub, 'Abdullah bin 'Amr, Samurah bin Jundub, Abu Hurayrah, Abu Sa'id, Hafsah, Umm Habibah, Umm Salamah, Ibn 'Abbas and 'A'ishah. This is also the Tafsir of 'Ubaydah, Ibrahim An-Nakha'i, Razin, Zirr bin Hubaysh, Sa'id bin Jubayr, Ibn Sirin, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Kalbi, Muqatil, 'Ubayd bin Abu Maryam, and others.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Proof that the 'Asr Prayer is the Middle Prayer</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad reported that 'Ali narrated that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said during the battle of Al-Ahzab <span class=\"gray\">(the Confederates)</span>:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">شَغَلُونَا عَنِ الصَّلَاةِ الْوُسْطَى، صَلَاةِ الْعَصْرِ، مَلَأَ اللهُ قُلُوبَهُم وَبُيُوتَـهم نَارًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They <span class=\"gray\">(the disbelievers)</span> busied us from performing the Middle prayer, the 'Ar prayer, may Allah fill their hearts and houses with fire.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He performed the 'Asr prayer between Maghrib and 'Isha'. Muslim and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith. In addition, the Two Shaykhs, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi An-Nasa'i and several other collectors of the Sunan recorded this Hadith using different chains of narrators to 'Ali. The Hadith about the battle of Al-Ahzab, when the Mushriks prevented Allah's Messenger ﷺ and his Companions from performing the 'Asr prayer, has been narrated by several other Companions. We only mentioned the narrations that stated that the Middle prayer is the 'Asr prayer. Furthermore, Muslim reported similar wordings for this Hadith from Ibn Mas'ud and Al-Bara' bin 'Azib.</p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">In addition, Imam Ahmad reported that Samurah bin Jundub said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">صَلَاةُ الْوسْطَى صَلَاةُ الْعَصْرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Middle prayer is the 'Asr prayer.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In another narration, Allah's Messenger ﷺ mentioned:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَافِظُوا عَلَى الصَّلَوَاتِ وَالصَّلَاةِ الْوُسْطَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Guard strictly <span class=\"gray\">(five obligatory)</span> As-Salawat <span class=\"gray\">(the prayers)</span> especially the Middle Salah)</span> and stated that it is the 'Asr prayer. In another narration, Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هِيَ الْعَصْرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is the 'Asr prayer.)</span> and Ibn Ja'far mentioned that the Prophet ﷺ was then being asked about the Middle prayer. At-Tirmidhi reported this Hadith and said, \"Hasan, Sahih.\" In addition, Abu Hatim bin Hibban reported in his Sahih that 'Abdullah said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">صَلَاةُ الْوسْطَى صَلَاةُ الْعَصْرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Middle prayer is the 'Asr prayer.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">At-Tirmidhi reported that Ibn Mas'ud narrated that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">صَلَاةُ الْوسْطَى صَلَاةُ الْعَصْرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The 'Asr prayer is the Middle prayer.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">At-Tirmidhi then stated that this Hadith is of a Hasan, Sahih type. Muslim reported the Hadith in his Sahih and his wordings are:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">شَغَلُونَا عَنِ الصَّلَاةِ الْوسْطَى صَلَاةِ الْعَصْرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They <span class=\"gray\">(disbelievers)</span> busied us from performing the Middle prayer, the 'Asr prayer.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">These texts emphasize the fact <span class=\"gray\">(that the 'Asr prayer is the Middle prayer)</span>. What further proves this fact is that, in an authentic Hadith, Allah's Messenger ﷺ emphasized the necessity of preserving the 'Asr prayer, when he said, as Ibn 'Umar narrated:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ فَاتَتْهُ صَلَاةُ الْعَصْرِ فَكَأَنَّمَا وُتِرَ أَهْلَهُ وَمَالَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever misses the 'Asr prayer will be like who has lost his family and money.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It is reported in the Sahih that Buraydah bin Al-Husayb said that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَكِّرُوا بِالصَّلَاةِ فِي يَوْمِ الْغَيْمِ، فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ تَرَكَ صَلَاةَ الْعَصْرِ، فَقَدْ حَبِطَ عَمَلُهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On a cloudy day, perform the <span class=\"gray\">('Asr)</span> prayer early, for whoever misses the 'Asr prayer, will have his <span class=\"gray\">(good)</span> deeds annulled.)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Prohibition of speaking during the Prayer</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَقُومُوا لِلَّهِ قَانِتِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And stand before Allah with obedience.)</span> meaning, with humbleness and humility before Him <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., during the prayer)</span>. This command indicates that it is not allowed to speak during the prayer, as speaking contradicts the nature of the prayer. This is why the Prophet ﷺ refused to answer Ibn Mas'ud when he greeted him while he was praying and said afterwards:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ فِي الصَّلَاةِ لَشُغْلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The prayer makes one sufficiently busy.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(i.e., by the various actions of the body, tongue and heart involved during the prayer.)</span></p><p lang=\"zh-Latn\" class=\"zh-Latn \">Muslim reported that the Prophet ﷺ said to Mu'awiyah bin Hakam As-Sulami when he spoke during the prayer:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ هذِهِ الصَّلَاةَ لَا يَصْلُحُ فِيهَا شَيْءٌ مِنْ كَلَامِ النَّاسِ، إنَّمَا هِي التَّسْبِيحُ وَالتَّكْبِيرُ وَذِكْرُ اللهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The ordinary speech people indulge in is not appropriate during the prayer. The prayer involves only Tasbih <span class=\"gray\">(praising Allah)</span>, Takbir <span class=\"gray\">(saying Allahu Akbar, i.e., Allah is the Most Great)</span> and remembering Allah.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad reported that Zayd bin Arqam said, \"One used to address his friend about various affairs during the prayer. Then when this Ayah was revealed:</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَقُومُوا لِلَّهِ قَانِتِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And stand before Allah with obedience.)</span> we were ordered to refrain from speaking.\" The Group <span class=\"gray\">(i. e., the Hadith collections)</span>, except Ibn Majah, reported this Hadith.</p><div lang=\"ga\" class=\"ga \"><h2>The Fear Prayer</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ فَرِجَالًا أَوْ رُكْبَانًا فَإِذَا أَمِنتُمْ فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَمَا عَلَّمَكُم مَّا لَمْ تَكُونُوا تَعْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if you fear <span class=\"gray\">(an enemy)</span>, <span class=\"gray\">(perform Salah)</span> on foot or riding. And when you are in safety, then remember Allah <span class=\"gray\">(pray)</span> in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not <span class=\"gray\">(before)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">After Allah commanded His servants to perform the prayer perfectly and emphasized this commandment, He mentioned the situation where the person might not be able to perform the prayer perfectly, during battle and combat. Allah said:</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ فَرِجَالًا أَوْ رُكْبَانًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if you fear <span class=\"gray\">(an enemy)</span>, perform Salah on foot or riding.)</span> meaning, pray in the appropriate manner under these circumstances, whether on foot or riding and whether facing the Qiblah or otherwise. Imam Malik reported that Nafi' related that Ibn 'Umar used to describe the Fear prayer when he was asked about it and would then add, \"If there is intense fear, pray on foot, riding, facing the Qiblah and otherwise.\" Nafi' commented, \"I think that he related that to the Prophet ﷺ.\" Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported the Hadith.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah and Ibn Jarir reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Allah has ordained the prayer by the words of your Prophet ﷺ: four <span class=\"gray\">(Rak'ah)</span> while residing, two Rak'ah while traveling and one Rak'ah during times of fear.\" This is also the view of Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, and others.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In addition, Al-Bukhari has entitled a Chapter: 'Prayer while confronting the Forts and facing the Enemy'. Al-Awza'i said, \"If the victory seems near and the Muslims are unable to perform the prayer <span class=\"gray\">(in the normal manner)</span>, they should pray by nodding each by himself. If they are unable to nod, they should delay the prayer until fighting is finished. When they feel safe, they should pray two Rak'ah. If they are unable, they should then pray one Rak'ah that includes two prostrations. If they are unable, then Takbir alone does not suffice, so they should delay the prayer until they are safe.\" This is the same view that Makhul held. Anas bin Malik said, \"I participated in the attack on the fort of Tastar, when the light of dawn started to become clear. Suddenly, the fighting raged and the Muslims were unable to pray until the light of day spread. We then prayed <span class=\"gray\">(the Dawn prayer)</span> with Abu Musa and we became victorious. I would not have been pleased if I were to gain in the life of this world and whatever is in it instead of that prayer.\" This is the wording of Al-Bukhari.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Prayer during the Times of Peace is performed normally</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِذَا أَمِنتُمْ فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when you are in safety, then remember Allah <span class=\"gray\">(pray)</span>)</span> meaning, 'Perform the prayer as I have commanded you by completing its bowing, prostration, standing, sitting, and with the required attention <span class=\"gray\">(in the heart)</span> and supplication.' Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَمَا عَلَّمَكُم مَّا لَمْ تَكُونُوا تَعْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not <span class=\"gray\">(before)</span>.)</span> meaning, just as He has endowed you, guided you and taught you about what benefits you in this life and the Hereafter, so thank and remember Him. Similarly, Allah said after He mentioned the prayer of Fear,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِذَا اطْمَأْنَنتُمْ فَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ إِنَّ الصَّلَاةَ كَانَتْ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ كِتَابًا مَّوْقُوتًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...but when you are free from danger, perform As-Salah. Verily, As-Salah <span class=\"gray\">(the prayer)</span> is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:103)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">We will mention the Hadiths about the prayer of Fear and its description in Surat An-Nisa' while mentioning Allah's statement:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا كُنتَ فِيهِمْ فَأَقَمْتَ لَهُمُ الصَّلَاةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When you <span class=\"gray\">(O Messenger Muhammad ﷺ)</span> are among them, and lead them in As-Salah <span class=\"gray\">(the prayer)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:102)</span></p>"
