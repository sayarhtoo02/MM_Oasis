Protect yourselves and your families against a Fire <span class=\"gray\">(Hell)</span> whose fuel is men and stones, over which are <span class=\"gray\">(appointed)</span> angels stern <span class=\"gray\">(and)</span> severe, who disobey not the commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded <span>(6)</span><span class=\"gray\">(It will be said in the Hereafter)</span> O you who disbelieve!

When one sees disobedience, he stops them and forbids them from doing it.\" Similar was said by Ad-Dahhak and Muqatil; \"It is an obligation for the Muslim to teach his near family members, and his male and female slaves what Allah has made obligatory for them and what Allah has forbidden for them.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There is a Hadith that confirms the meaning of this Ayah. Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi recorded that Ar-Rabi' bin Sabrah said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">مُرُوا الصَّبِيَّ بِالصَّلَاةِ إِذَا بَلَغَ سَبْعَ سِنِينَ، فَإِذَا بَلَغَ عَشْرَ سِنِينَ فَاضْرِبُوهُ عَلَيْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Order the children to pray when they reach the age of seven and when they reach the age of ten, discipline them for <span class=\"gray\">(not performing)</span> it.)</span> This is the narration that Abu Dawud collected; At-Tirmidhi said, \"This Hadith is Hasan.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Fuel for Hell and a Description of its Angels</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(whose fuel is men and stones,)</span> indicating that the Children of Adam will be fuel for the Fire that will feed it,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْحِجَارَةُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and stones)</span> in reference to the idols that were worshipped, just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Certainly you and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are <span class=\"gray\">(but)</span> fuel for Hell!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(21:98)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Mujahid, Abu Ja'far Al-Baqir and As-Suddi said that these are sulfur stones that are more putrid than rotten corpses, according to Mujahid. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَلَيْهَا مَلَائِكَةٌ غِلَاظٌ شِدَادٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(over which are <span class=\"gray\">(appointed)</span> angels stern <span class=\"gray\">(and)</span> severe,)</span> means, their nature of behavior is stern, because the mercy has been taken out of their hearts for those who disbelieve in Allah,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\"> شِدَادٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(severe)</span> meaning, their structure is powerful, strong and frightening,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا يَعْصُونَ اللَّهَ مَا أَمَرَهُمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(who disobey not the commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.)</span> meaning, whatever Allah commands them, they rush to obey Him, without delay for even a twinkling of an eye. They are able to fulfill the command; they are called Az-Zabaniyah, meaning, the keepers and guards of Hell, may Allah give us shelter from them.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">No Excuse will be accepted from the Disbeliever on the Day of Resurrection</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَا تَعْتَذِرُوا الْيَوْمَ ۖ إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنْتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who disbelieve! Make no excuses this Day! You are being requited only for what you used to do.)</span> meaning, on the Day of Resurrection, the disbeliever will be told, \"Do not offer any excuse this Day, because it will not be accepted from you; you will only be recompensed for what you used to do. Today, you will receive the punishment for your actions.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Encouraging sincere Repentance</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah the Exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا تُوبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ تَوْبَةً نَصُوحًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance!)</span> meaning, a true, firm repentance that erases the evil sins that preceded it and mend the shortcoming of the repenting person, encouraging and directing him to quit the evil that he used to do. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَسَىٰ رَبُّكُمْ أَنْ يُكَفِّرَ عَنْكُمْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَيُدْخِلَكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow)</span> And when Allah says, \"it may be,\" it means He shall.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ لَا يُخْزِي اللَّهُ النَّبِيَّ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَعَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(the Day that Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believe with him)</span> meaning, on the Day of Resurrection, Allah will not disgrace those who believed in the Prophet ﷺ,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نُورُهُمْ يَسْعَىٰ بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَبِأَيْمَانِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Their light will run forward before them and in their right hands.)</span> as we explained in Surat Al-Hadid,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> يَقُولُونَ رَبَّنَا أَتْمِمْ لَنَا نُورَنَا وَاغْفِرْ لَنَا ۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They will say:\"Our Lord! Keep perfect our light for us and grant us forgiveness. Verily, You are Able to do all things.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and Al-Hasan Al-Basri and other said, \"This is the statement that the believers will say on the Day of Resurrection, when they witness the light of the hypocrites being extinguished.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that a man from the tribe of Banu Kinanah said, \"I prayed behind the Messenger of Allah ﷺ during the year of the Conquest <span class=\"gray\">(of Makkah)</span>, and heard him say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللّٰهُمَّ لَا تُخْزِنِي يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Allah!

Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be severe against them; their abode will be Hell, and worst indeed is that destination <span>(9)</span>Allah sets forth an example for those who disbelieve: the wife of Nuh and the wife of Lut. They were under two of our righteous servants, but they both betrayed them. So, they availed them not against Allah and it was said: \"Enter the Fire along with those who enter! <span>(10)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Command for Jihad against the Disbelievers and the Hypocrites</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah the Exalted orders His Messenger ﷺ to perform Jihad against the disbelievers and hypocrites, the former with weapons and armaments and the later by establishing Allah's legislated penal code,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and be severe against them)</span> meaning, in this life,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(their abode will be Hell, and worst indeed is that destination.)</span> that is, in the Hereafter.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Disbeliever shall never benefit from His Believing Relative on the Day of Resurrection</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah the exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ضَرَبَ اللَّهُ مَثَلًا لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah sets forth an example for those who disbelieve)</span> meaning, the disbelievers who live together in this life with Muslims, their mixing and mingling with Muslims will not help the disbelievers, nor will it avail them with Allah, until and unless they gain faith in their hearts. Then Allah mentioned the parable, saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">امْرَأَتَ نُوحٍ وَامْرَأَتَ لُوطٍ ۖ كَانَتَا تَحْتَ عَبْدَيْنِ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا صَالِحَيْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(the wife of Nuh and the wife of Lut. They were under two of our righteous servants,)</span> means, they were the wives of two of Allah's Messengers and were their companions by day and night, eating with them and sleeping with them, as much as any marriage contains of interaction between spouses. However,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> فَخَانَتَاهُمَا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(they both betrayed them.)</span> meaning, in the faith, they did not adhere to the faith sent through their husbands nor accepted their message. Therefore, all the intimate knowledge of their husbands neither helped them nor prevented punishment, hence Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَمْ يُغْنِيَا عَنْهُمَا مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So, they availed them not against Allah)</span> means, because their wives were disbelievers,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\"> وَقِيلَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and it was said)</span> meaning, to these wives,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ادْخُلَا النَّارَ مَعَ الدَّاخِلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Enter the Fire along with those who enter!)</span> The part of the Ayah that reads,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَخَانَتَاهُمَا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but they both betrayed them)</span> does not pertain to committing illegal sexual intercourse, but to refusing to accept the religion. Surely, the wives of the Prophets were immune from committing illegal sexual intercourse on account of the honor that Allah has granted His Prophets, as we explained in Surat An-Nur. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-'Awfi reported from Ibn 'Abbas, \"They betrayed them by not following their religion. The wife of Prophet Nuh used to expose his secrets, informing his oppressive people whenever any person embraced the faith with Nuh. As for the wife of Prophet Lut, she used to inform the people of the city <span class=\"gray\">(Sodom)</span>, who committed the awful sexual act <span class=\"gray\">(sodomy)</span>, whenever a guest was entertained by her husband.\" Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"No wife of a Prophet ever committed adultery and fornication. Rather, they betrayed them by refusing to follow their religion.\" Similar was said by 'Ikrimah, Sa'id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and others.</p>"
