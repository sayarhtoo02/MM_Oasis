That is very easy for Him, because He created the heavens and the earth, and creating them is greater than creating mankind, the first time and when He creates them again. The One Who is able to do that is able to do anything that is less than that. As Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّ اللَّهَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَلَمْ يَعْيَ بِخَلْقِهِنَّ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَىٰ أَنْ يُحْيِيَ الْمَوْتَىٰ ۚ بَلَىٰ إِنَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do they not see that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and was not wearied by their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Yes, He surely is able to do all things.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(46:33)</span> And Allah says here:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَخَلْقُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind; yet, most of mankind know not.)</span> hence they do not think about or ponder this proof. Similarly, many of the Arabs recognized that Allah had created the heavens and the earth, but they denied and rejected the idea of the resurrection; they acknowledged something which was greater than that which they denied. Then Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا يَسْتَوِي الْأَعْمَىٰ وَالْبَصِيرُ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَلَا الْمُسِيءُ ۚ قَلِيلًا مَا تَتَذَكَّرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And not equal are the blind and those who see; nor are those who believe, and do righteous good deeds, and those who do evil. Little do you remember!)</span> The blind man who cannot see anything is not the same as the sighted man who can see everything as far as his eyesight reaches – there is a huge difference between them. By the same token, the righteous believers and the immoral disbelievers are not equal.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَلِيلًا مَا تَتَذَكَّرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Little do you remember!)</span> means, most of the people remember little.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ السَّاعَةَ لَآتِيَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the Hour <span class=\"gray\">(Day of Judgement)</span> is surely coming,)</span> means, it will indeed come to pass.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا رَيْبَ فِيهَا وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(there is no doubt about it, yet most men believe not.)</span> means, they do not believe in it, and in fact they doubt its existence altogether.</p>"

Verily, those who scorn My worship they will surely enter Hell in humiliation! <span>(60)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Command to call upon Allah </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">By His grace and kindness, Allah encourages His servants to call upon Him, and He guarantees to respond. Sufyan Ath-Thawri used to say: \"O You Who love most those who ask of You, and O You Who hate most those who do not ask of You, and there is no one like that apart from You, O Lord.\" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Similarly; the poet said: \"Allah hates not to be asked, and the son of Adam hates to be asked.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Qatadah said that Ka'b Al-Ahbar said, \"This Ummah has been given three things which were not given to any nation before, only to Prophets. When Allah sent a Prophet, He said to him, 'You are a witness over your nation.' But you have been made witnesses over mankind; it was said to the Prophets individually, 'Allah has not laid upon you any hardship in religion,' but He said to this entire Ummah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and <span class=\"gray\">[Allah]</span> has not laid upon you in religion any hardship)</span><span class=\"gray\">(22:78)</span> and it was said to the Prophets individually; 'Call upon Me, I will answer you,' but it was said to this Ummah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Call upon Me, I will answer you)</span>.\" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Nu'man bin Bashir, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الدُّعَاءَ هُوَ الْعِبَادَةُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Indeed the supplication is the worship.)</span>\" Then he recited,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِي سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَاخِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And your Lord said: \"Call upon Me, I will answer you. Verily, those who scorn My worship they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!\")</span>. This was also recorded by the Sunan compilers; At-Tirmdhi, An-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, and Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" It was also recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Jarir with a different chain of narration. Allah's saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, those who scorn My worship)</span> means, 'those who are too proud to call on Me and single Me out,'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَاخِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!)</span> means, in disgrace and insignificance. Imam Ahmad recorded from 'Amr bin Shu'ayb from his father, from his grandfather that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُحْشَرُ الْمُتَكَبِّرُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَمْثَالَ الذَّرِّ فِي صُوَرِ النَّاسِ، يَعْلُوهُمْ كُلُّ شَيْءٍ مِنَ الصَّغَارِ، حَتّٰى يَدْخُلُوا سِجْنًا فِي جَهَنَّمَ يُقَالُ لَهُ: بُولَسُ، تَعْلُوهُمْ نَارُ الْأنْيَارِ، يُسْقَوْنَ مِنْ طِينَةِ الْخَبَالِ، عُصَارَةِ أَهْلِ النَّارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The proud will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection like ants in the image of people, and everything will be stepping on them, humiliating them, until they enter a prison in Hell called Bulas. They will be fed flames of fire, and given for drink a paste of insanity dripping from the people the Fire.)</span>\"</p>"
