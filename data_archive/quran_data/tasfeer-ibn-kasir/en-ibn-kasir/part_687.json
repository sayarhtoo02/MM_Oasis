If it was)</span> meaning, this Qur'an.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مِنْ عِنْدِ اللَّهِ وَكَفَرْتُمْ بِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(from Allah, and you disbelieved in it?)</span> meaning, 'what do you think that Allah will do to you if this Book that I have come to you with is actually revealed to me from Him in order that I convey it to you, and yet you disbelieve in it and deny it?'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(at the same time)</span>, a witness from among the Children of Israel has testified to something similar)</span> meaning, 'the previous Scriptures that were revealed to the Prophets before me all testify to its truthfulness and authenticity. They have prophecied, well in advance, about things similar to that which this Qur'an informs of.' Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">فَآمَنَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and believed)</span> 'this person who testified to its truthfulness from the Children of Israel, due to his realization that it was the truth.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(while you rejected <span class=\"gray\">(the truth)</span>!)</span> 'whereas you have arrogantly refused to follow it.' Masruq said: \"That witness believed in his Prophet and Book, while you disbelieved in your Prophet and Book.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.)</span> The witness here refers to any witness in general. It includes 'Abdullah bin Salam and other from them as well. For indeed, this Ayah was revealed in Makkah before 'Abdullah bin Salam had accepted Islam. This is similar to the statement of Allah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ قَالُوا آمَنَّا بِهِ إِنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّنَا إِنَّا كُنَّا مِنْ قَبْلِهِ مُسْلِمِينَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when it is recited to them, they say: \"We believe in it. Verily, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed, even before it we have been Muslims.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(28:53)</span> It is also similar to Allah's saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْعِلْمَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِ إِذَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ يَخِرُّونَ لِلْأَذْقَانِ سُجَّدًا - وَيَقُولُونَ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّنَا إِنْ كَانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّنَا لَمَفْعُولًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily! Those who were given knowledge before it – when it is recited to them, they fall upon their faces in prostration, and they say: \"Exalted is our Lord! Truly, the promise of our Lord has been fulfilled.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:107-108)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It has been narrated from Sa'd, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said, \"I have not heard Allah's Messenger ﷺ say about anyone walking on the surface of the earth that he is of the people of Jannah – except for 'Abdullah bin Salam. Concerning him the following Ayah was revealed,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَشَهِدَ شَاهِدٌ مِنْ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَىٰ مِثْلِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(at the same time)</span>, a witness from among the Children of Israel has testified to something similar)</span>\" </p><p lang=\"fil\" class=\"fil \">This has been recorded in the Two Sahihs and An-Nasa'i. Similarly, Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, 'Ikrimah, Yusuf bin 'Abdullah bin Salam, Hilal bin Yasaf, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri, Malik bin Anas and Ibn Zayd all said that this refers to 'Abdullah bin Salam. Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَوْ كَانَ خَيْرًا مَا سَبَقُونَا إِلَيْهِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who disbelieve say of those who believe: \"Had it been good, they <span class=\"gray\">(the weak and poor)</span> would not have preceded us to it!\")</span> which means that those who disbelieve say of those who believe in the Qur'an: \"Had it <span class=\"gray\">(the Qur'an)</span> been any good, they <span class=\"gray\">(the weak and poor)</span> would not have preceded us to it!\" By that, they meant Bilal, 'Ammar, Suhayb, Khabbab, may Allah be pleased with them, and others like them of the weak, the male servants, and female servants. The pagans said this only because they thought that they held a high status with Allah, and that He took special care of them. By that, they made a great and obvious error, as Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَذَٰلِكَ فَتَنَّا بَعْضَهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ لِيَقُولُوا أَهَٰؤُلَاءِ مَنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ مِنْ بَيْنِنَا ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Thus have We tried some of them with others, that they might say: \"Is it these whom Allah has favored from among us?\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:53)</span> meaning, they wonder how could those weaklings be the ones who were guided from among them. Thus, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> لَوْ كَانَ خَيْرًا مَا سَبَقُونَا إِلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Had it been good, they <span class=\"gray\">(the weak and poor)</span> would not have preceded us to it!)</span> Contrary to this is the position of Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah: They say about any act or saying that has not been reported from the Companions: \"It is an innovation. If there was any good in it, they would have preceded us in doing it, because they have not left off any of the good characteristics except that they hurried to perform them.\" Allah continues,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذْ لَمْ يَهْتَدُوا بِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when they have not been guided by it,)</span> meaning, the Qur'an.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَسَيَقُولُونَ هَٰذَا إِفْكٌ قَدِيمٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(they say: \"This is an ancient falsehood!\")</span> meaning, an old lie. They mean by this that the Qur'an has been quoted and taken from the ancient people, thereby belittling the Qur'an and its followers. This is clear arrogance, as Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَطَرُ الْحَقِّ وَغَمْطُ النَّاسِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(Arrogance is)</span> rejecting the truth and belittling the people.)</span> Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">وَمِنْ قَبْلِهِ كِتَابُ مُوسَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And before this was the Scripture of Musa)</span> and it was the Tawrah.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِمَامًا وَرَحْمَةً ۚ وَهَٰذَا كِتَابٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(as a guide and mercy. And this is a Book)</span> meaning, the Qur'an.</p><p class=\"ru qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ru\">مُصَدِّقٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(confirming)</span> meaning, that which came before it of the previous Books.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِسَانًا عَرَبِيًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(in the Arabic tongue,)</span> means that it is eloquent and clear.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> لِيُنْذِرَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُحْسِنِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(to warn those who do wrong, and as glad tidings for the doers of good.)</span> meaning, it contains a warning to the disbelievers and glad tidings for the believers. Allah then says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَامُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, those who say: \"Our Lord is <span class=\"gray\">(only)</span> Allah,\" and thereafter stand firm,)</span> The explanation of this has been discussed earlier in Surat As-Sajdah. <span class=\"gray\">[See 41:30]</span> Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(on them shall be no fear,)</span> meaning, concening their future.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(nor shall they grieve.)</span> meaning, over what they have left behind. Allah continues,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ الْجَنَّةِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا جَزَاءً بِمَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Such shall be the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein <span class=\"gray\">(forever)</span> – a reward for what they used to do.)</span> meaning, the deeds are a cause for their attaining the mercy and their being engulfed by it – and Allah knows best.</p>"
