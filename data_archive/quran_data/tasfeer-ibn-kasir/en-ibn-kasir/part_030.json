However, it was as if one of them felt something in himself <span class=\"gray\">(against my attending)</span>. So he said, 'Why do you <span class=\"gray\">('Umar)</span> bring this <span class=\"gray\">(youth)</span> to sit with us when we have children like him <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., his age)</span>?' So 'Umar replied, 'Verily, he is among those whom you know.'</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then one day he called them and invited me to sit with them, and I do not think that he invited me to be among them that day except to show them. So he said, 'What do you say about Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا جَاءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest.)</span>?'</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Some of them said, 'We were commanded to praise Allah and seek His forgiveness when He helps us and gives us victory.' Some of them remained silent and did not say anything. Then he <span class=\"gray\">('Umar)</span> said to me, 'Is this what you say, O Ibn 'Abbas?' I said, 'No.' He then said, 'What do you say?' I said, 'It was the end of the life of Allah's Messenger ﷺ that Allah was informing him of. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا جَاءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">which means, that is a sign of the end of your life.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَاسْتَغْفِرْهُ ۚ إِنَّهُ كَانَ تَوَّابًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So, glorify the praises of your Lord, and ask His forgiveness.

O Allah, forgive me.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He did this as his interpretation of the Qur'an <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., showing its implementation)</span>.\" The rest of the group has also recorded this Hadith except for At-Tirmidhi.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded from Masruq that 'A'ishah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to often say towards the end of his life,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ، أَسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Glory to Allah, and praise be unto Him. I seek Allah's forgiveness and I repent to Him.)</span></p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">And he ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">إِنَّ رَبِّي كَانَ أَخْبَرَنِي أَنِّي سَأَرَى عَلَامَةً فِي أُمَّتِي، وَأَمَرَنِي إِذَا رَأَيْتُهَا أَنْ أُسَبِّحَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَأَسْتَغْفِرَهُ، إِنَّهُ كَانَ تَوَّابًا، فَقَدْ رَأَيْتُهَا:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا جَاءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ - وَرَأَيْتَ النَّاسَ يَدْخُلُونَ فِي دِينِ اللَّهِ أَفْوَاجًا - فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَاسْتَغْفِرْهُ ۚ إِنَّهُ كَانَ تَوَّابًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, my Lord has informed me that I will see a sign in my Ummah and He has commanded me that when I see it, I should glorify His praises and seek His forgiveness, for He is the One Who accepts repentance. And indeed I have seen it <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., the sign)</span>. <span class=\"gray\">(When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest <span class=\"gray\">(Al-Fath)</span>. And you see that the people enter Allah's religion in crowds. So glorify the praises of your Lord, and ask His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives.)</span>)</span>\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The meaning of Al-Fath here is the conquest of Makkah, and there is only one view concerning it. For indeed the different areas of the Arabs were waiting for the conquest of Makkah before they would accept Islam. They said, \"If he <span class=\"gray\">(Muhammad ﷺ is victorious over his people, then he is a <span class=\"gray\">(true)</span> Prophet.\" So when Allah gave him victory over Makkah, they entered into the religion of Allah <span class=\"gray\">(Islam)</span> in crowds. Thus, two years did not pass <span class=\"gray\">(after the conquest of Makkah)</span> before the peninsula of the Arabs was laden with faith. And there did not remain any of the tribes of the Arabs except that they professed <span class=\"gray\">(their acceptance)</span> of Islam. And all praise and blessings are due to Allah.</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari recorded in his Sahih that 'Amr bin Salamah said, \"When Makkah was conquered, all of the people rushed to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ to profess their Islam. The various regions were delaying their acceptance of Islam until Makkah was conquered. The people used to say, 'Leave him and his people alone. If he is victorious over them he is a <span class=\"gray\">(true)</span> Prophet.'\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">We have researched the war expedition for conquest of Makkah in our book As-Surah. Therefore, whoever wishes he may review it there. And all praise and blessings are due to Allah.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu 'Ammar that a neighbor of Jabir bin 'Abdullah told him, \"I returned from a journey and Jabir bin 'Abdullah came and greeted me. So I began to talk with him about the divisions among the people and what they had started doing. Thus, Jabir began to cry and he said, 'I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ النَّاسَ دَخَلُوا فِي دِينِ اللهِ أَفْوَاجًا، وَسَيَخْرُجُونَ مِنْهُ أَفْوَاجًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the people have entered into the religion of Allah in crowds and they will also leave it in crowds.)</span>\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat An-Nasr, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah.</p>"
