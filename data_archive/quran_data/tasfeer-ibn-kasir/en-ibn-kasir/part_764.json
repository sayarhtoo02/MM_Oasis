    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He who obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allah, but he who turns away, then We have not sent you as a watcher over them <span>(80)</span>They say: \"We are obedient,\" but when they leave you, a section of them spends all night in planning other than what you say. But Allah records their nightly <span class=\"gray\">(plots)</span>. So turn aside from them <span class=\"gray\">(do not punish them)</span>, and put your trust in Allah. And Allah is Ever All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs <span>(81)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Obeying the Messenger <span class=\"gray\">(ﷺ)</span> is Obeying Allah</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah states that whoever obeys His servant and Messenger, Muhammad ﷺ, obeys Allah; and whoever disobeys him, disobeys Allah. Verily, whatever the Messenger ﷺ utters is not of his own desire, but a revelation inspired to him. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ أَطَاعَنِي فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ اللهَ، وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَقَدْ عَصَى اللهَ، وَمَنْ أَطَاعَ الْأَمِيرَ فَقَدْ أَطَاعَنِي، وَمَنْ عَصَى الْأَمِيرَ فَقَدْ عَصَانِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever obeys me, obeys Allah; and whoever disobeys me, disobeys Allah. Whoever obeys the Amir <span class=\"gray\">(leader, ruler)</span>, obeys me; and whoever disobeys the Amir, disobeys me.)</span> This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن تَوَلَّىٰ فَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But he who turns away, then We have not sent you as a watcher over them.)</span> means, do not worry about him. Your job is only to convey, and whoever obeys you, he will acquire happiness and success and you will gain a similar reward to that he earns. As for the one who turns away from you, he will gain failure and loss and you will not carry a burden because of what he does. A Hadith states,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ يُطِعِ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ رَشَدَ، وَمَنْ يَعْصِ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَضُرُّ إِلَّا نَفْسَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, will acquire guidance; and whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, will only harm himself.)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Foolishness of the Hypocrites</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَقُولُونَ طَاعَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They say: \"We are obedient,\")</span>. Allah states that the hypocrites pretend to be loyal and obedient.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> فَإِذَا بَرَزُوا مِنْ عِندِكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but when they leave you)</span>, meaning, when they depart and are no longer with you,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَيَّتَ طَائِفَةٌ مِّنْهُمْ غَيْرَ الَّذِي تَقُولُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(a section of them spends all night in planning other than what you say)</span>. They plot at night among themselves for other than what they pretend when they are with you. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ يَكْتُبُ مَا يُبَيِّتُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But Allah records their nightly <span class=\"gray\">(plots)</span>.)</span> meaning, He has full knowledge of their plots and records it through His command to His scribes, the angels who are responsible for recording the actions of the servants.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is a threat from Allah, stating that He knows what the hypocrites try to hide, their plotting in the night to defy the Messenger ﷺ and oppose him, even though they pretend to be loyal and obedient to him. Allah will certainly punish them for this conduct. In a similar Ayah, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالرَّسُولِ وَأَطَعْنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They <span class=\"gray\">(hypocrites)</span> say: \"We have believed in Allah and in the Messenger, and we obey,\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[22:47]</span> until the end of the Ayah. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">فَأَعْرِضْ عَنْهُمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So turn aside from them)</span> means, pardon them, be forbearing with them, do not punish them, do not expose them to the people and do not fear them.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ وَكِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and put your trust in Allah. And Allah is Ever All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.)</span> meaning, He is sufficient as Protector, Supporter and Helper for those who rely on Him and return to Him.</p>"

    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Do they not then consider the Qur'an carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely, have found therein contradictions in abundance <span>(82)</span>When there comes to them some matter touching <span class=\"gray\">(public)</span> safety or fear, they make it known <span class=\"gray\">(among the people)</span>; if only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them <span class=\"gray\">(directly)</span>. Had it not been for the grace and mercy of Allah upon you, you would have followed Shaytan, except a few of you <span>(83)</span></p><div lang=\"mt\" class=\"mt \"><h2>The Qur'an is True</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah commands them to contemplate about the Qur'an and forbids them from ignoring it, or ignoring its wise meanings and eloquent words. Allah states that there are no inconsistencies, contradictions, conflicting statements or discrepancies in the Qur'an, because it is a revelation from the Most-Wise, Worthy of all praise. Therefore, the Qur'an is the truth coming from the Truth, Allah. This is why Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ أَمْ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبٍ أَقْفَالُهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do they not then think deeply in the Qur'an, or are their hearts locked up <span class=\"gray\">(from understanding it)</span>?)</span><span class=\"gray\">[47:24]</span> Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِندِ غَيْرِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Had it been from other than Allah,)</span> meaning, had it been fraudulent and made up, as the ignorant idolators and hypocrites assert in their hearts,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَوَجَدُوا فِيهِ اخْتِلَافًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(they would surely, have found therein contradictions)</span>, discrepancies and inconsistencies,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَثِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(in abundance)</span>. However, this Qur'an is free of shortcomings, and therefore, it is from Allah. Similarly, Allah describes those who are firmly grounded in knowledge,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">آمَنَّا بِهِ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ رَبِّنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We believe in it, all of it is from our Lord.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(3:7)</span> meaning, the Muhkam sections <span class=\"gray\">(entirely clear)</span> and the Mutashabih sections <span class=\"gray\">(not entirely clear)</span> of the Qur'an are all true. So they understand the not entirely clear from the clear, and thus gain guidance. As for those in whose heart is the disease of hypocrisy, they understand the Muhkam from the Mutashabih; thus only gaining misguidance. Allah praised those who have knowledge and criticized the wicked.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that 'Amr bin Shu'ayb said that his father said that his grandfather said, \"I and my brother were present in a gathering, which is more precious to me than red camels. My brother and I came and found that some of the leaders of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ were sitting close to a door of his. We did not like the idea of being separate from them, so we sat near the room. They then mentioned an Ayah and began disputing until they raised their voices. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ was so angry that when he went out his face was red. He threw sand on them and said to them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَهْلًا يَا قَوْمِ، بِهَذَا أُهْلِكَتِ الْأُمَمُ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ، بِاخْتِلَافِهِمْ عَلى أَنْبِيَائِهِمْ، وضربهم الْكُتُبَ بَعْضَهَا بِبَعْضٍ، إِنَّ الْقُرْآنَ لَمْ يَنْزِلْ يُكَذِّبُ بَعْضُهُ بَعْضًا، إِنَّمَا يُصَدِّقُ بَعْضُهُ بَعْضًا، فَمَا عَرَفْتُمْ مِنْهُ فَاعْمَلُوا بِهِ، وَمَا جَهِلْتُمْ مِنْهُ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلى عَالِمِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Behold, O people! This is how the nations before you were destroyed, because of their disputing with their Prophets and their contradicting parts of the Books with other parts. The Qur'an does not contradict itself. Rather, it testifies to the truth of itself. Therefore, whatever of it you have knowledge in, then implement it, and whatever you do not know of it, then refer it to those who have knowledge in it.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ahmad recorded that 'Abdullah bin 'Amr said, \"I went to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ one day. When we were sitting, two men disputed about an Ayah, and their voices became loud. The Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّمَا هَلَكَتِ الْأُمَمُ قَبْلَكُمْ بِاخْتِلَافِهِمْ فِي الْكِتَابِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the nations before you were destroyed because of their disagreements over the Book.)</span> Muslim and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Prohibition of Disclosing Unreliable and Uninvestigated News</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا جَاءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الْأَمْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُوا بِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When there comes to them some matter touching <span class=\"gray\">(public)</span> safety or fear, they make it known <span class=\"gray\">(among the people)</span>;)</span> chastising those who indulge in things before being sure of their truth, disclosing them, making them known and spreading their news, even though such news might not be true at all. In the introduction to his Sahih, Imam Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَفَى بِالْمَرْءِ كَذِبًا أَنْ يُحَدِّثَ بِكُلِّ مَا سَمِعَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Narrating everything one hears is sufficient to make a person a liar.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the same narration collected by Abu Dawud in the section of Adab <span class=\"gray\">(manners)</span> in his Sunan. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Al-Mughirah bin Shu'bah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ prohibited, \"It was said,\" and, \"So-and-so said.\" This Hadith refers to those who often convey the speech that people utter without investigating the reliability and truth of what he is disclosing. The Sahih also records,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ حَدَّثَ بِحَدِيثٍ وَهُوَ يُرَى أَنَّهُ كَذِبٌ، فَهُوَ أَحَدُ الْكَاذِبَيْنَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever narrates a Hadith while knowing it is false, then he is one of the two liars <span class=\"gray\">(who invents and who spreads the lie)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">We should mention here the Hadith of 'Umar bin Al-Khattab collected in the Two Sahihs. When 'Umar was informed that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ divorced his wives, he came from his house, entered the Masjid and found the people talking about this news. He could not wait and went to the Prophet ﷺ to ask him about what had truly happened, asking him, \"Have you divorced your wives?\" The Prophet ﷺ said, \"No.\" 'Umar said, \"I said, Allahu Akbar...\" and mentioned the rest of the Hadith. In the narration that Muslim collected, 'Umar said, \"I asked, 'Have you divorced them?' He said, 'No.' So, I stood by the door of the Masjid and shouted with the loudest voice, 'The Messenger of Allah ﷺ did not divorce his wives.' Then, this Ayah was revealed,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا جَاءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الْأَمْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُوا بِهِ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَىٰ أُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When there comes to them some matter touching <span class=\"gray\">(public)</span> safety or fear, they make it known <span class=\"gray\">(among the people)</span>, if only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them <span class=\"gray\">(directly)</span>.)</span> So I properly investigated that matter.\" This Ayah refers to proper investigation, or extraction of matters from their proper resources. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَاتَّبَعْتُمُ الشَّيْطَانَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(you would have followed Shaytan except a few of you.)</span> refers to the believers, as 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn 'Abbas.</p>"
