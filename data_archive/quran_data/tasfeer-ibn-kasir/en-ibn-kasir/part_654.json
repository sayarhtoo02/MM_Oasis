    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And who is better in speech than he who invites to Allah, and does righteous deeds, and says: \"I am one of the Muslims. <span>(33)</span>The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel <span class=\"gray\">(the evil)</span> with one which is better, then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, <span class=\"gray\">(will become)</span> as though he was a close friend <span>(34)</span>But none is granted it except those who are patient – and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion in this world <span>(35)</span>And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away, then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower <span>(36)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Virtue of calling Others to Allah</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ قَوْلًا مِمَّنْ دَعَا إِلَى اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And who is better in speech than he who invites to Allah,)</span> means, he calls the servants of Allah to Him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا وَقَالَ إِنَّنِي مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and does righteous deeds, and says: \"I am one of the Muslims.\")</span> means, he himself follows that which he says, so it benefits him as well as others. He is not one of those who enjoin good but do not do it themselves, or who forbid evil yet they do it themselves. He does good and avoids doing evil, and he calls people to their Creator, may He be blessed and exalted. This is general in meaning and applies to everyone who calls people to what is good and is himself guided by what he says. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ is the foremost among people in this regard, as Muhammad bin Sirin, As-Suddi and 'Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was also said that what was meant here is the righteous Mu'adhdhin, as it was mentioned in Sahih Muslim:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْمُؤَذِّنُونَ أَطْوَلُ النَّاسِ أَعْنَاقًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Mu'adhdhins will be the ones with the longest necks on the Day of Resurrection.)</span>\" In As-Sunan it is reported that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْإِمَامُ ضَامِنٌ، وَالْمُؤَذِّنُ مُؤْتَمَنٌ، فَأَرْشَدَ اللهُ الْأَئِمَّةَ وَغَفَرَ لِلْمُؤَذِّنِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Imam is a guarantor and the Mu'adhdhin is in a position of trust. May Allah guide the Imams and forgive the Mu'adhdhin.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The correct view is that the Ayah is general in meaning, and includes the Mu'adhdhin and others. When this Ayah was revealed, the Adhan had not been prescribed at all. The Ayah was revealed in Makkah, and the Adhan was prescribed in Al-Madinah after the Hijrah, when it was shown to 'Abdullah bin 'Abd Rabbihi Al-Ansari in a dream. He told the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about it, and he told him to teach it to Bilal, may Allah be pleased with him, who had a more beautiful voice, as we have discussed elsewhere. So the correct view is that the Ayah is general in meaning, as 'Abdur-Razzaq said, narrating from Ma'mar, from Al-Hasan Al-Basri, who recited this Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ قَوْلًا مِمَّنْ دَعَا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا وَقَالَ إِنَّنِي مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And who is better in speech than he who invites to Allah, and does righteous deeds, and says: \"I am one of the Muslims.\")</span> and said, \"This is the beloved of Allah, this is the close friend of Allah, this is the chosen one of Allah, this is the most beloved of the all the people of earth to Allah. He responded to the call of Allah and called mankind to that to which he had responded. He did righteous deeds in response and said, 'I am one of the Muslims.' This is Allah's Khalifah.\"</p><p lang=\"co\" class=\"co \">Wisdom in Da'wah etc.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَسْتَوِي الْحَسَنَةُ وَلَا السَّيِّئَةُ ۚ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal.)</span> means, there is a huge difference between them.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Repel <span class=\"gray\">(the evil)</span> with one which is better,)</span> means, 'when someone does you wrong, repel him by treating him well,' as 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"There is no better punishment for one who has disobeyed Allah with regard to you, than your obeying Allah with regard to him.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> فَإِذَا الَّذِي بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَهُ عَدَاوَةٌ كَأَنَّهُ وَلِيٌّ حَمِيمٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, <span class=\"gray\">(will become)</span> as though he was a close friend.)</span> means, 'if you treat well those who treat you badly, this good deed will lead to reconciliation, love and empathy, and it will be as if he is a close friend to you and he will feel pity for you and be kind to you.' Then Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلَّا الَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But none is granted it except those who are patient)</span> meaning, no one accepts this advice and works according to it, except for those who can be patient in doing so, for it is difficult for people to do.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلَّا ذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion)</span> means, the one who has a great portion of happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas explained this Ayah: \"Allah commands the believers to be patient when they feel angry, to be forbearing when confronted with ignorance, and to forgive when they are mistreated. If they do this, Allah will save them from the Shaytan and subdue their enemies to them until they become like close friends.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِمَّا يَنْزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away, then seek refuge in Allah.)</span> means, the devils among men may be deceived by your kind treatment of him, but the devils among the Jinn, when they insinuate their evil whispers, cannot be dealt with except by seeking refuge with the Creator Who gave him power over you. If you seek refuge with Allah and turn to Him, He will stop him from harming you and bring his efforts to naught. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood up to pray, he would say:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ السَّمِيعِ الْعَلِيمِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ، مِنْ هَمْزِهِ وَنَفْخِهِ وَنَفْثِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I seek refuge in Allah the All-Hearing, All-Knowing, from the accursed Shaytan and his evil insinuations, breath and impurity.)</span>\" We have already stated that there is nothing like this in the Qur'an, apart from the passage in Surat Al-A'raf, where Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خُذِ الْعَفْوَ وَأْمُرْ بِالْعُرْفِ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ الْجَاهِلِينَ - وَإِمَّا يَنْزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish. And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is All-Hearer, All-Knower.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7:199-200)</span> and the passage in Surat Al-Mu'minun where Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ السَّيِّئَةَ ۚ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَصِفُونَ - وَقُلْ رَبِّ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ هَمَزَاتِ الشَّيَاطِينِ - وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ رَبِّ أَنْ يَحْضُرُونِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with the things they utter. And say: \"My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings of the Shayatin. And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(23:96-98)</span></p>"

Do not prostrate yourselves to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to Allah Who created them, if you worship Him <span>(37)</span>But if they are too proud, then there are those who are with your Lord glorify Him night and day, and never are they tired <span>(38)</span>And among His signs; that you see the earth barren, but when We send down water to it, it is stirred to life and growth.

Allah's saying;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And from among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon.)</span> means, He created the night with its darkness and the day with its light, and they alternate without ceasing. And He created the sun with its shining light, and the moon with its reflected light. and He allotted their stages and gave them separate orbits in the heavens, so that by the variations in their movements man may know the stages of night and day, of weeks, months and years, and time periods related to people's rights, acts of worship and various transactions. Moreover, because the sun and moon are the most beautiful of the heavenly bodies that can be seen in both the upper and lower realms, Allah points out that they are created entities which are in a state of enthrallment to Him, subject to His dominion and control. So He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do not prostrate yourselves to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to Allah Who created them, if you <span class=\"gray\">(really)</span> worship Him.)</span> meaning, 'do not associate anything in worship with Him, for your worship of Him will be of no benefit to you if you worship others alongside Him, because He does not forgive the association of others in worship with Him.' He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِنِ اسْتَكْبَرُوا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But if they are too proud,)</span> i.e., to worship Him Alone, and they insist on associating others with Him,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> فَالَّذِينَ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(then there are those who are with your Lord)</span> i.e., the angels,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُسَبِّحُونَ لَهُ بِاللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَهُمْ لَا يَسْأَمُونَ ۩</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(glorify Him night and day, and never are they tired.)</span> This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> فَإِنْ يَكْفُرْ بِهَا هَٰؤُلَاءِ فَقَدْ وَكَّلْنَا بِهَا قَوْمًا لَيْسُوا بِهَا بِكَافِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But if these disbelieve therein, then, indeed We have entrusted it to a people who are not disbelievers therein.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:89)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And among His signs)</span> means, signs of His ability to bring the dead back to life.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> أَنَّكَ تَرَى الْأَرْضَ خَاشِعَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that you see the earth barren,)</span> means, lifeless, with nothing growing in it; it is dead.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِذَا أَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَاءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but when We send down water <span class=\"gray\">(rain)</span> to it, it is stirred to life and growth.)</span> means, it brings forth all kinds of crops and fruits.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِي أَحْيَاهَا لَمُحْيِي الْمَوْتَىٰ ۚ إِنَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, He Who gives it life, surely is able to give life to the dead.
