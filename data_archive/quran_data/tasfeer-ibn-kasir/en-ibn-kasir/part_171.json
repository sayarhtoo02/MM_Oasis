They will say: \"Woe to us! What sort of Book is this that leaves neither a small thing nor a large thing, but has recorded it with numbers!\" And they will find all that they did, present, and your Lord treats no one with injustice <span>(49)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Major Terrors of the Hour</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah tells us of the terrors of the Day of Resurrection, and the awesome things that will come to pass, as He says elsewhere:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ تَمُورُ السَّمَاءُ مَوْرًا - وَتَسِيرُ الْجِبَالُ سَيْرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day when the heaven will shake with a dreadful shaking, And the mountains pass moving away.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[52:9-10]</span> meaning, they will move from their places and will vanish. As Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَرَى الْجِبَالَ تَحْسَبُهَا جَامِدَةً وَهِيَ تَمُرُّ مَرَّ السَّحَابِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And you will see the mountains and think them solid, but they shall pass away as the passing away of the clouds.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[27:88]</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَكُونُ الْجِبَالُ كَالْعِهْنِ الْمَنفُوشِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the mountains will be like carded wool.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[101:5]</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّي نَسْفًا - فَيَذَرُهَا قَاعًا صَفْصَفًا - لَّا تَرَىٰ فِيهَا عِوَجًا وَلَا أَمْتًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they ask you about the mountains, say: \"My Lord will pulverize them scattering <span class=\"gray\">[their dust]</span>. To leave them as a barren plain. You will not see in it crookness or curve.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[20:105-107]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah tells us that He will cause the mountains to vanish and be levelled, and the earth will be left as a smooth plain, a level surface with nothing crooked or curved therein, no valleys or mountains. So Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَرَى الْأَرْضَ بَارِزَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and you will see the earth as a levelled plain,)</span> meaning clear and open, with no features that anyone may recognize and nothing for anyone to hide behind. All creatures will be visible to their Lord, and not one of them will be hidden from Him. Mujahid and Qatadah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَرَى الْأَرْضَ بَارِزَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and you will see the earth as a levelled plain,)</span> \"No one will be hidden or absent.\" Qatadah said, \"There will be no buildings and no trees.\"</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَحَشَرْنَاهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and we shall gather them, so that We will not leave one of them behind.)</span> means, 'We shall gather them all, the first of them and the last of them, and We shall not leave anyone behind, young or old.' As Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ إِنَّ الْأَوَّلِينَ وَالْآخِرِينَ - لَمَجْمُوعُونَ إِلَىٰ مِيقَاتِ يَوْمٍ مَّعْلُومٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"<span class=\"gray\">(yes)</span> verily, those of old, and those of later times.

This is why Allah says to them:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَلْ زَعَمْتُمْ أَلَّن نَّجْعَلَ لَكُم مَّوْعِدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Nay, but you thought that We had appointed no meeting for you <span class=\"gray\">(with Us)</span>.)</span>, meaning, you did not think that this would happen to you or that it would come to pass.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَابُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the Book will be produced,)</span> the Book of deeds, which contains a record of everything, major or minor, significant or insignificant, great or small.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَتَرَى الْمُجْرِمِينَ مُشْفِقِينَ مِمَّا فِيهِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and you will see the criminals, fearful of that which is therein.)</span> of their evil deeds and reprehensible actions.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَقُولُونَ يَا وَيْلَتَنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They will say, \"Woe to us!\")</span> expressing words of regret for having wasted their lives.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَالِ هَٰذَا الْكِتَابِ لَا يُغَادِرُ صَغِيرَةً وَلَا كَبِيرَةً إِلَّا أَحْصَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(What sort of Book is this that leaves neither a small thing nor a large thing, but has recorded it with numbers!)</span> it has left no sin, major or minor, and no action, no matter how small, but it has recorded it with the utmost precision and accuracy.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَوَجَدُوا مَا عَمِلُوا حَاضِرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they will find all that they did, present,)</span> everything, both good and evil, as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ تَجِدُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا عَمِلَتْ مِنْ خَيْرٍ مُّحْضَرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day when every person will be confronted with all the good he has done)</span><span class=\"gray\">[3:30]</span>. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُنَبَّأُ الْإِنسَانُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[75:13]</span> And Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ تُبْلَى السَّرَائِرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Day when all the secrets will be exposed.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[86:9]</span> meaning, everything that is hidden in people's hearts will become known. Imam Ahmad recorded from Anas that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِكُلِّ غَادِرٍ لِوَاءٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يُعْرَفُ بِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Every traitor will have a banner on the Day of Resurrection, by which he will be known.)</span> It was also narrated in the Two Sahihs, where one narration says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُرْفَعُ لِكُلِّ غَادِرٍ لِوَاءٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عِنْدَ اسْتِهِ بِقَدْرِ غَدْرَتِهِ، يُقَالُ: هَذِهِ غَدْرَةُ فُلَانِ بْنِ فُلَانٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day of Resurrection, for every traitor a banner will be erected by his backside, and it will be said, \"This is the betrayer of so-and-so the son of so-and-so.\")</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and your Lord treats no one with injustice.)</span> means, He will judge between His creatures for all of their deeds, and He will not treat any of His creatures with injustice. He will overlook and forgive and have mercy, and He will punish whomever He wills by His power, wisdom and justice. He will fill Hell with the disbelievers and those who have been disobedient. Then He will rescue the disobedient, and leave the disbelievers there for eternity. He is the Judge Who never wrongs or oppresses. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ ۖ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَاعِفْهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely, Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust, but if there is any good, He doubles it.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[4:40]</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَنَضَعُ الْمَوَازِينَ الْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ فَلَا تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We shall set up Balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything.)</span> Until His saying;</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">حَاسِبِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(to take account)</span><span class=\"gray\">[21:47]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And there are many similar Ayat.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that 'Abdullah bin Muhammad bin 'Aqil heard Jabir bin 'Abdullah say, \"I was told about a Hadith which a man heard from the Prophet ﷺ, so I bought a camel and put my saddle on it, then I traveled on it for a month until I came to Ash-Sham, where 'Abdullah bin Unays was. I said to the doorkeeper, 'Tell him that Jabir is at the door.' He said, 'Jabir bin 'Abdullah?' I said, 'Yes.' So he came out, still putting his garment on, and embraced me, and I embraced him, and said: 'I heard a Hadith narrated by you, that you heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about reciprocal punishments. I was afraid that you or I would die before I could hear it.' He said, 'I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَحْشُرُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ النَّاسَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ - أَوْ قَالَ: الْعِبَادَ - عُرَاةً غُرْلًا بُهْمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah will gather the people – or His servants – on the Day of Resurrection, naked, uncircumcised and Buhman.)</span> I asked, 'What is Buhman?'

Then a voice will call out to them that will be heard by those far away just as easily as it will be heard by those near: \"I am the Sovereign, I am the Judge. None of the people of Hell should enter Hell if he is owed something by one of the people of Paradise, until I have settled the matter, and none of the people of Paradise should enter Paradise if he is owed something by one of the people of Hell, until I settle the matter – even if it is only the case of a slap.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">We said, 'How will that be, when we have come before Allah barefooted, naked, uncircumcised and having nothing with us?' He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِالْحَسَنَاتِ وَالسَّيِّئَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By <span class=\"gray\">[merit for]</span> good deeds, and <span class=\"gray\">[recompense]</span> for evil deeds.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Shu'bah narrated from Al-'Awwam bin Muzahim from Abu 'Uthman from 'Uthman bin 'Affan, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الْجَمَّاءَ لَتَقْتَصُّ مِنَ الْقَرْنَاءِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The animal who lost a horn will settle the score with the one that has horns on the Day of Resurrection.)</span> It was recorded by 'Abdullah the son of Imam Ahmad, and there are corroborating narrations through other routes.</p>"
