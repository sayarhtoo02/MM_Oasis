    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">They have mentioned that 'Amr bin Al-'As went to visit Musaylimah Al-Kadhdhab after the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was commissioned <span class=\"gray\">(as a Prophet)</span> and before 'Amr had accepted Islam. Upon his arrival, Musaylimah said to him, \"What has been revealed to your friend <span class=\"gray\">(Muhammad ﷺ)</span> during this time?\" 'Amr said, \"A short and concise Surah has been revealed to him.\" Musaylimah then said, \"What is it?\" 'Amr replied;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْعَصْرِ - إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ - إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By Al-'Asr. Verily, man is in loss. Except those who believe and do righteous deeds, and recommend one another to the truth, and recommend one another to patience.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So Musaylimah thought for a while. Then he said, \"Indeed something similar has also been revealed to me.\" 'Amr asked him, \"What is it?\" He replied, \"O Wabr <span class=\"gray\">(a small, furry mammal; hyrax)</span>, O Wabr! You are only two ears and a chest, and the rest of you is digging and burrowing.\" Then he said, \"What do you think, O 'Amr?\" So 'Amr said to him, \"By Allah! Verily, you know that I know you are lying.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">I saw that Abu Bakr Al-Khara'iti mentioned a chain of narration for part of this story, or what was close to its meaning, in volume two of his famous book Masawi' ul-Akhlaq. The Wabr is a small animal that resembles a cat, and the largest thing on it is its ears and its torso, while the rest of it is ugly. Musaylimah intended by the composition of these nonsensical verses to produce something which would oppose the Qur'an. Yet, it was not even convincing to the idol worshipper of that time. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">At-Tabarani recorded from 'Abdullah bin Hisn Abi Madinah that he said, \"Whenever two men from the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to meet, they would not part until one of them had recited Surat Al-'Asr in its entirety to the other, and one of them had given the greetings of peace to the other.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ash-Shafi'i said, \"If the people were to ponder on this Surah, it would be sufficient for them.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْعَصْرِ - إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ - إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(1. By Al-'Asr.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2. Verily, man is in loss.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(3. Except those who believe and do righteous deeds, and recommend one another to the truth, and recommend one another to patience.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-'Asr is the time in which the movements of the Children of Adam occur, whether good or evil. Malik narrated from Zayd bin Aslam that he said, \"It is the evening.\" However, the first view is the popular opinion. Thus, Allah swears by this, that man is in Khusr, which means in loss and destruction.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Except those who believe and do righteous good deeds)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So Allah makes an exception, among the species of man being in loss, for those who believe in their hearts and work righteous deeds with their limbs.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And recommend one another to the truth,)</span> This is to perform acts of obedience and avoid the forbidden things.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And recommend one another to patience.)</span> meaning, with the plots, the evils, and the harms of those who harm people due to their commanding them to do good and forbidding them from evil.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-'Asr, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>"

In pillars stretched forth.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Hammaz refers to <span class=\"gray\">(slander)</span> by speech, and Al-Lammaz refers to <span class=\"gray\">(slander)</span> by action. This means that the person finds fault with people and belittles them. An explanation of this has already preceded in the discussion of Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">هَمَّازٍ مَّشَّاءٍ بِنَمِيمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Hammaz, going about with slander)</span><span class=\"gray\">(68:11)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Humazah Lumazah means one who reviles and disgraces <span class=\"gray\">(others)</span>.\" Mujahid said, \"Al-Humazah is with the hand and the eye, and Al-Lumazah is with the tongue.\" Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِي جَمَعَ مَالًا وَعَدَّدَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who has gathered wealth and counted it.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, he gathers it piling some of it on top of the rest and he counts it up. This is similar to Allah's saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَمَعَ فَأَوْعَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And collect <span class=\"gray\">(wealth)</span> and hide it.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(70:18)</span> This was said by As-Suddi and Ibn Jarir. Muhammad bin Ka'b said concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">جَمَعَ مَالًا وَعَدَّدَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(gathered wealth and counted it.)</span> \"His wealth occupies his time in the day, going from this to that. Then when the night comes he sleeps like a rotting corpse.\" Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَحْسَبُ أَنَّ مَالَهُ أَخْلَدَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He thinks that his wealth will make him last forever!)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, he thinks that gathering wealth will make him last forever in this abode <span class=\"gray\">(the worldly life)</span>.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">كَلَّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But no!)</span> meaning, the matter is not as he claims, nor as he reckons. Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيُنبَذَنَّ فِي الْحُطَمَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, he will be thrown into Al-Hutamah.)</span> meaning, the person who gathered wealth and counted it, will be thrown into Al-Hutamah, which is one of the descriptive names of the Hellfire. This is because it crushes whoever is in it. Thus, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا الْحُطَمَةُ - نَارُ اللَّهِ الْمُوقَدَةُ - الَّتِي تَطَّلِعُ عَلَى الْأَفْئِدَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And what will make you know what Al-Hutamah is? The fire of Allah, Al-Muqadah, which leaps up over the hearts.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Thabit Al-Bunani said, \"It will burn them all the way to their hearts while they are still alive.\" Then he said, \"Indeed the torment will reach them.\" Then he cried. Muhammad bin Ka'b said, \"It <span class=\"gray\">(the Fire)</span> will devour every part of his body until it reaches his heart and comes to the level of his throat, then it will return to his body.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّهَا عَلَيْهِم مُّؤْصَدَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, it shall Mu'sadah upon them.)</span> meaning, covering, just as was mentioned in the Tafsir of Surat Al-Balad <span class=\"gray\">(see 90:20)</span>. Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِي عَمَدٍ مُّمَدَّدَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In pillars stretched forth.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"Atiyah Al-'Awfi said, \"Pillars of Iron.\" As-Suddi said, \"Made of fire.\" Al-'Awfi reported from Ibn 'Abbas, \"He will make them enter pillars stretched forth, meaning there will be columns over them, and they will have chains on their necks, and the gates <span class=\"gray\">(of Hell)</span> will be shut upon them.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Humazah, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>"
