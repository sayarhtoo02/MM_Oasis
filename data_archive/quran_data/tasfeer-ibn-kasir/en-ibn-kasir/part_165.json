'Ikrimah said: \"There was a group of them who said that the souls would be resurrected but not the bodies, so Allah resurrected the people of the Cave as a sign and proof of resurrection.\" They mentioned that when they wanted to send one of their members out to the city to buy them something to eat, he disguised himself and set out walking by a different route, until he reached the city, which they said was called Daqsus. He thought that it was not long since he left it, but in fact century after century, generation after generation, nation after nation had passed, and the country and its people had changed. He saw no local landmarks that he recognized, and he did not recognize any of the people, elite or commoners. He began to feel confused and said to himself, \"Maybe I am crazy or deluded, maybe I am dreaming.\" Then he said, \"By Allah, I am nothing of the sort, what I know I saw last night was different from this.\" Then he said, \"I had better get out of here.\" Then he went to one of the men selling food, gave him the money he had and asked him to sell him some food. When the man saw the money he did not recognize it or its imprint, so he passed it to his neighbor and they all began to pass it around, saying, \"Maybe this man found some treasure.\" They asked him who he was and where he got this money. Had he found a treasure? Who was he? He said, \"I am from this land, I was living here yesterday and Decianus was the ruler.\" They accused him of being crazy and took him to the governor who questioned him about his circumstances, and he told him. He was confused about his situation. When he told them about it, they – the king and the people of the city – went with him to the cave, where he told them, \"Let me go in first and let my companions know.\" It was said that the people did not know how he entered it, and that the people did not know about their story. It was also said that they did enter the cave and see them, and the king greeted them and embraced them. Apparently he was a Muslim, and his name was Tedosis. They rejoiced at meeting him and spoke with him, then they bid farewell to him and went back to sleep, then Allah caused them to die. And Allah knows best.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَعْثَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And thus We made their case known,)</span> meaning, 'just as We caused them to sleep then woke them up physically intact, We made their story known to the people of that time.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِيَعْلَمُوا أَنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَأَنَّ السَّاعَةَ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهَا إِذْ يَتَنَازَعُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ أَمْرَهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour. <span class=\"gray\">(Remember)</span> when they <span class=\"gray\">(the people)</span> disputed among themselves about their case,)</span> meaning, about Resurrection. Some believed in it and some denied it, so Allah made their discovery of the people of the cave evidence either in their favor or against them.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَقَالُوا ابْنُوا عَلَيْهِم بُنْيَانًا ۖ رَّبُّهُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(they said: \"Construct a building over them; their Lord knows best about them,\")</span> meaning, seal the door of their cave over them, and leave them as they are.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ الَّذِينَ غَلَبُوا عَلَىٰ أَمْرِهِمْ لَنَتَّخِذَنَّ عَلَيْهِم مَّسْجِدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(those who won their point said: \"We verily, shall build a place of worship over them.\")</span> Those who said this were the people of power and influence, but were they good people or not? There is some debate on this point, because the Prophet ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَعَنَ اللهُ الْيَهُودَ وَالنَّصَارَى اتَّخَذُوا قُبُورَ أَنْبِيَائِهِمْ وَصَالِحِيهِمْ مَسَاجِدَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah has cursed the Jews and the Christians who took the graves of their Prophets and righteous people as places of worship)</span> Warning against what they did. We have reported about the Commander of the faithful 'Umar bin Al-Khattab that when he found the grave of Danyal <span class=\"gray\">(Daniel)</span> in Iraq during his period of rule, he gave orders that news of this grave should be withheld from the people, and that the inscription containing mention of battles etc., that they found there should be buried.</p>"

Say: \"My Lord knows best their number; none knows them but a few.\" So debate not except with the clear proof. And consult not any of them <span class=\"gray\">(about the people of the Cave)</span><span>(22)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Their Number</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah tells us that people disputed over the number of the people of the Cave. The Ayah mentions three views, proving that there was no fourth suggestion. Allah indicates that the first two opinions are invalid, by saying,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">رَجْمًا بِالْغَيْبِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(guessing at the unseen)</span>, meaning that they spoke without knowledge, like a person who aims at an unknown target – he is hardly likely to hit it, and if he does, it was not on purpose.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah mentions the third opinion, and does not comment on it, or He affirms it by saying,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَثَامِنُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and the dog being the eighth.)</span> indicating that this is correct and this is what happened.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُل رَّبِّي أَعْلَمُ بِعِدَّتِهِم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"My Lord knows best their number...\")</span> indicating that the best thing to do in matters like this is to refer knowledge to Allah, because there is no need to indulge in discussing such matters without knowledge. If we are given knowledge of a matter, then we may talk about it, otherwise we should refrain.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَّا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(none knows them but a few.)</span> of mankind. Qatadah said that Ibn 'Abbas said: \"I am one of the few mentioned in this Ayah; they were seven. \" Ibn Jurayj also narrated that 'Ata' Al-Khurasani narrated from him, \"I am one of those referred to in this Ayah,\" and he would say: \"Their number was seven.\" Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَّا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(none knows them but a few.)</span> \"I am one of the few, and they were seven.\" The chains of these reports narrated from Ibn 'Abbas, which say that they were seven, are Sahih, and this is in accordance with what we have stated above.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا تُمَارِ فِيهِمْ إِلَّا مِرَاءً ظَاهِرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So debate not except with the clear proof.)</span> meaning, gently and politely, for there is not a great deal to be gained from knowing about that.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَلَا تَسْتَفْتِ فِيهِم مِّنْهُمْ أَحَدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And consult not any of them <span class=\"gray\">(about the people of the Cave)</span>.)</span> meaning, 'They do not have any knowledge about it except what they make up, guessing at the unseen; they have no evidence from an infallible source. But Allah has sent you, O Muhammad, with the truth in which there is no doubt or confusion, which is to be given priority over all previous books and sayings.'</p>"
