    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And <span class=\"gray\">(remember)</span> when Musa said to his boy-servant: \"I will not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas or a Huqub passes. <span>(60)</span>But when they reached the junction of the two seas, they forgot their fish, and it took its way through the sea as in a tunnel <span>(61)</span>So when they passed further on, Musa said to his boy-servant: \"Bring us our morning meal; truly, we have suffered Nasaban in this, our journey. <span>(62)</span>He said: \"Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock? I indeed forgot the fish; none but Shaytan made me forget to remember it. It took its course into the sea in a strange <span class=\"gray\">(way <span>(63)</span><span class=\"gray\">[Musa]</span> said: \"That is what we have been seeking.\" So they went back retracing their footsteps <span>(64)</span>Then they found one of Our servants, on whom We had bestowed mercy from Us, and whom We had taught knowledge from Us <span>(65)</span></span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Story of Musa and Al-Khidr</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The reason for Musa's conversation with the boy-servant, Yusha' bin Nun, was that he had been told about one of the servants of Allah at the junction of the two seas, who had knowledge which Musa had not been granted, so he wanted to travel to meet him. So he said to that boy-servant of his:</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">لَا أَبْرَحُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I will not give up)</span> meaning, I will keep on traveling,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَتَّىٰ أَبْلُغَ مَجْمَعَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(until I reach the junction of the two seas)</span> meaning, the place where the two seas met.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">أَوْ أَمْضِيَ حُقُبًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(or a Huqub passes.)</span> meaning, even if I have to travel for a very long time. Ibn Jarir <span class=\"gray\">(may Allah have mercy on him)</span> said, \"Some of the scholars of the Arabic language said that Huqub means a year in the dialect of <span class=\"gray\">[the tribe of]</span> Qays,\" then he narrated that 'Abdullah bin 'Amr said, \"Huqub means eighty years.\" Mujahid said, \"Seventy years.\" 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas said that it means a lifetime. Qatadah and Ibn Zayd said likewise.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَمَّا بَلَغَا مَجْمَعَ بَيْنِهِمَا نَسِيَا حُوتَهُمَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But when they reached the junction of the two seas, they forgot their fish,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He had been commanded to carry a salted fish with him, and it had been said to him, when you lose the fish, that will be a sign that you have reached the right place. So they set out and traveled until they reached the junction of the two seas, where there was a spring called 'Ayn Al-Hayat <span class=\"gray\">(the Spring of Life)</span>. They went to sleep there, and the fish felt the drops of that water, so it came back to life. It was in a vessel with Yusha', upon him be peace, and it jumped out of the vessel towards the sea. Yusha' woke up and the fish fell into the water and started to swim through the water, leaving a track or channel behind it. Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَاتَّخَذَ سَبِيلَهُ فِي الْبَحْرِ سَرَبًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and it took its way through the sea as in a tunnel.)</span> meaning, like going through a tunnel on land. Ibn Jurayj said, \"Ibn 'Abbas said, 'It left a trace as if it were a rock.'\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَمَّا جَاوَزَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So when they had passed further on,)</span> means, past the place where they had forgotten the fish. Forgetfulness is attributed to them both even though it was actually Yusha' who forgot. This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَخْرُجُ مِنْهُمَا اللُّؤْلُؤُ وَالْمَرْجَانُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Out of them both come out pearl and coral.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[55:22]</span>, although they come from the salt water, according to one of the two opinions. When they had passed one stage beyond the place where they had forgotten the fish,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ لِفَتَاهُ آتِنَا غَدَاءَنَا لَقَدْ لَقِينَا مِن سَفَرِنَا هَٰذَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">[Musa]</span> said to his boy-servant: \"Bring us our morning meal; truly, we have suffered in this, our journey)</span> meaning, their journey beyond the place where they should have stopped.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نَصَبًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Nasaban)</span> means, exhaustion.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ أَرَأَيْتَ إِذْ أَوَيْنَا إِلَى الصَّخْرَةِ فَإِنِّي نَسِيتُ الْحُوتَ وَمَا أَنسَانِيهُ إِلَّا الشَّيْطَانُ أَنْ أَذْكُرَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He said: \"Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock?

Al-Bukhari recorded that Sa'id bin Jubayr said, \"I said to Ibn 'Abbas: 'Nawf Al-Bikali claims that Musa, the companion of Al-Khidr was not the Musa of the Children of Israel.' Ibn 'Abbas said, 'The enemy of Allah has told a lie.' Ubayy bin Ka'b narrated that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ مُوسَى قَامَ خَطِيبًا فِي بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ فَسُئِلَ: أَيُّ النَّاسِ أَعْلَمُ؟ قَالَ: أَنَا، فَعَتَبَ اللهُ عَلَيْهِ إِذْ لَمْ يَرُدَّ الْعِلْمَ إِلَيْهِ، فَأَوْحَى اللهُ إِلَيْهِ إِنَّ لِي عَبْدًا بِمَجْمَعِ الْبَحْرَيْنِ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ مِنْكَ. قَالَ مُوسَى: يَا رَبِّ وَكَيْفَ لِي بِهِ؟ قَالَ: تَأْخُذُ مَعَكَ حُوتًا فَتَجْعَلَهُ بِمِكْتَلٍ، فَحَيْثُمَا فَقَدْتَ الْحُوتَ فَهُوَ ثَمَّ، فَأَخَذَ حُوتًا فَجَعَلَهُ بِمِكْتَلٍ، ثُمَّ انْطَلَقَ وَانْطَلَقَ مَعَهُ فَتَاهُ يُوشَعُ بْنُ نُونٍ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ، حَتَّى إِذَا أَتَيَا الصَّخْرَةَ وَضَعَا رُءُوْسَهُمَا فَنَامَا، وَاضْطَرَبَ الْحُوتُ فِي الْمِكْتَلِ، فَخَرَجَ مِنْهُ فَسَقَطَ فِي الْبَحْرِ فَاتَّخَذَ سَبِيلَهُ فِي الْبَحْرِ سَرَبًا، وَأَمْسَكَ اللهُ عَنِ الْحُوتِ جِرْيَةَ الْمَاءِ، فَصَارَ عَلَيْهِ مِثْلَ الطَّاقِ، فَلَمَّا اسْتَيْقَظَ، نَسِيَ صَاحِبُهُ أَنْ يُخْبِرَهُ بِالْحُوتِ، فَانْطَلَقَا بَقِيَّةَ يَوْمِهِمَا وَلَيْلَتَهُمَا حَتَّى إِذَا كَانَ مِنَ الْغَدِ قَالَ مُوسَى لِفَتَاهُ:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">آتِنَا غَدَاءَنَا لَقَدْ لَقِينَا مِن سَفَرِنَا هَٰذَا نَصَبًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Musa got up to deliver a speech before the Children of Israel and he was asked, \"Who is the most learned person among the people?\" Musa replied, \"I am.\" Allah rebuked him because he did not refer the knowledge to Allah. So Allah revealed to him: \"At the junction of the two seas there is a servant of Ours who is more learned than you.\" Musa asked, \"O my Lord, how can I meet him?\" Allah said, \"Take a fish and put it in a vessel and then set out, and where you lose the fish, you will find him.\" So Musa took a fish, put it in a vessel and set out, along with his boy-servant Yusha' bin Nun, peace be upon him, till they reached a rock <span class=\"gray\">(on which)</span> they both lay down their heads and slept. The fish moved vigorously in the vessel and got out of it and fell into the sea and there it took its way through the sea <span class=\"gray\">(straight)</span> as in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water on both sides of the way created by the fish, and so that way was like a tunnel. When Musa got up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish, and so they carried on their journey during the rest of the day and the whole night. The next morning Musa said to his boy-servant,</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Bring us our morning meal; truly, we have suffered much fatigue in this, our journey.\")</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَمْ يَجِدْ مُوسَى النَّصَبَ حَتَّى جَاوَزَ الْمَكَانَ الَّذِي أَمَرَهُ اللهُ بِهِ، قَالَ لَهُ فَتَاه ُ</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَرَأَيْتَ إِذْ أَوَيْنَا إِلَى الصَّخْرَةِ فَإِنِّي نَسِيتُ الْحُوتَ وَمَا أَنسَانِيهُ إِلَّا الشَّيْطَانُ أَنْ أَذْكُرَهُ ۚ وَاتَّخَذَ سَبِيلَهُ فِي الْبَحْرِ عَجَبًا</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قاَل: فَكَانَ لِلْحُوتِ سَرَبًا، وَلِمُوسَى وَفَتَاهُ عَجَبًا، فَقَالَ:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَٰلِكَ مَا كُنَّا نَبْغِ ۚ فَارْتَدَّا عَلَىٰ آثَارِهِمَا قَصَصًا</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ: فَرَجَعَا يَقُصَّانِ أَثَرَهُمَا حَتَّى انْتَهَيَا إِلَى الصَّخْرَةِ، فَإِذَا رَجُلٌ مُسَجًّى بِثَوْبٍ، فَسَلَّمَ عَلَيْهِ موسَى فَقَالَ الْخَضِرُ: وَأَنَّى بِأَرْضِكَ السَّلَامُ. فَقَالَ: أَنَا مُوسَى. فَقَالَ: مُوسَى بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ، قَالَ: أَتَيْتُكَ لِتُعَلِّمَنِي مِمَّا عُلِّمْتَ رُشْدًا</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ إِنَّكَ لَن تَسْتَطِيعَ مَعِيَ صَبْرًا</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا مُوسَى إِنِّي عَلَى عِلْمٍ مِنْ علْمِ اللهِ عَلَّمَنِيهِ لَا تَعْلَمُهُ أَنْتَ وَأَنْتَ عَلَى عَلْمٍ مِنْ عِلْمِ اللهِ عَلَّمَكَهُ اللهُ لَا أَعْلَمُهُ.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Musa did not get tired till he had passed the place that Allah had ordered him to look for. His boy-servant then said to him,</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock? I indeed forgot the fish; none but Shaytan made me forget to remember it. It took its course into the sea in a strange way.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There was a tunnel for the fish and Musa and his boy-servant were amazed. Musa said,</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"That is what we have been seeking.\" So they went back retracing their footsteps.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So they went back retracing their steps until they reached the rock. There they found a man covered with a garment. Musa greeted him. Al-Khidr said, \"Is there such a greeting in your land?\" Musa said, \"I am Musa.\" He said, \"Are you the Musa of the Children of Israel?\" Musa said, \"Yes,\" and added, \"I have come to you so that you may teach me something of that knowledge which you have been taught.\" Al-Khidr said,</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"You will not be able to have patience with me.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">O Musa!

The crew recognized Al-Khidr and allowed them to go on board free of charge. When they went on board, suddenly Musa saw that Al-Khidr had pulled out one of the planks of the ship with an adz. Musa said to him, \"These people gave us a free ride, yet you have broken their boat so that its people will drown!
