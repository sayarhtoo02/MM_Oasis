    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And <span class=\"gray\">(remember)</span> Ibrahim when he said to his people: \"Worship Allah, and have Taqwa of Him, that is better for you if you know. <span>(16)</span>You worship besides Allah only idols, and you only invent falsehood. Verily, those whom you worship besides Allah have no power to give you provision, so seek from Allah your provision, and worship Him, and be grateful to Him. To Him you will be brought back <span>(17)</span>And if you deny, then nations before you have denied. And the duty of the Messenger is only to convey plainly. <span>(18)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Ibrahim's preaching to His People</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah tells us how His servant, Messenger and close friend Ibrahim, the Imam of the monotheists, called his people to worship Allah alone, with no partner or associate, to fear Him alone, to seek provision from Him alone, with no partner or associate, to give thanks to Him alone, for He is the One to Whom thanks should be given for the blessings which none can bestow but He. Ibrahim said to his people:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاتَّقُوهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Worship Allah, and have Taqwa of Him,)</span> meaning worship Him and fear Him Alone, with all sincerity.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that is better for you if you know.)</span> if you do that you will attain good in this world and the next, and you will prevent evil from yourselves in this world and the Hereafter. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah states that the idols which they worshipped were not able to do any harm or any good, and tells them, \"You made up names for them and called them gods, but they are created beings just like you.\" This interpretation was reported by Al-'Awfi from Ibn 'Abbas. It was also the view of Mujahid and As-Suddi. Al-Walibi reported from Ibn 'Abbas: \"You invent falsehood, means, you carve idols,\" which do not have the power to provide for you.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَابْتَغُوا عِنْدَ اللَّهِ الرِّزْقَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so seek from Allah your provision,)</span> This emphasizes the idea of asking Allah Alone. This is like the Ayat:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(You <span class=\"gray\">(Alone)</span> we worship, and You <span class=\"gray\">(Alone)</span> we ask for help.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(1:5)</span> And His saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبِّ ابْنِ لِي عِنْدَكَ بَيْتًا فِي الْجَنَّةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(My Lord! Build for me, with You, a home in Paradise)</span><span class=\"gray\">(66:11)</span>. Allah says here:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">فَابْتَغُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so seek)</span> meaning, ask for</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عِندَ اللَّهِ الرِّزْقَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(from Allah your provision,)</span> meaning, do not seek it from anyone or anything other than Him, for no one else possesses the power to do anything.</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">وَاعْبُدُوهُ وَاشْكُرُوا لَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and worship Him, and be grateful to Him.)</span> Eat from what He has provided and worship Him Alone, and give thanks to Him for the blessings He has given you.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(To Him you will be brought back.)</span> means, on the Day of Resurrection, when He will reward or punish each person according to his deeds. His saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنْ تُكَذِّبُوا فَقَدْ كَذَّبَ أُمَمٌ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if you deny, then nations before you have denied.)</span> means, 'you have heard what happened to them by way of punishment for opposing the Messengers.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا عَلَى الرَّسُولِ إِلَّا الْبَلَاغُ الْمُبِينُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the duty of the Messenger is only to convey plainly.)</span> All the Messengers have to do is to convey the Message as Allah has commanded them. Allah guides whoever He wills and leaves astray whoever He wills, so strive to be among the blessed. Qatadah said concerning the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنْ تُكَذِّبُوا فَقَدْ كَذَّبَ أُمَمٌ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if you deny, then nations before you have denied.)</span> \"These are words of consolation to His Prophet, peace be upon him.\" This suggestion by Qatadah implies that the narrative <span class=\"gray\">(about Ibrahim)</span> is interrupted here, and resumes with the words \"And nothing was the answer of <span class=\"gray\">(Ibrahim's)</span> people...\" in Ayah 24. This was also stated by Ibn Jarir. From the context it appears that Ibrahim, peace be upon him, said all of what is in this section. Here he establishes proof against them that the Resurrection will indeed come to pass, because at the end of this passage it says:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">فَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"And nothing was the answer of his people...\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(29:24)</span> And Allah knows best.</p>"

For Allah created them after they had been nothing at all, then they came into existence and became people who could hear and see. The One Who originated this is able to repeat it, it is very easy for Him. Then he taught them to contemplate the visible signs on the horizons and the things that Allah has created: the heavens with their stars and planets, moving and stationary, the earth with its plains and mountains, its valleys, deserts and wildernesses, trees and rivers, fruits and oceans. All of that indicates that these are themselves created things, and that there must be a Creator Who does as He chooses, Who merely says to a thing \"Be!\" and it is. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا كَيْفَ يُبْدِئُ اللَّهُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ ۚ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(See they not how Allah originates the creation, then repeats it. Verily, that is easy for Allah.)</span> This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him)</span><span class=\"gray\">(30:27)</span>. Then Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ سِيرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ فَانْظُرُوا كَيْفَ بَدَأَ الْخَلْقَ ۚ ثُمَّ اللَّهُ يُنْشِئُ النَّشْأَةَ الْآخِرَةَ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"Travel in the land and see how He originated the creation, and then Allah will bring forth the creation of the Hereafter.\")</span> meaning, the Day of Resurrection.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah is able to do all things.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُعَذِّبُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ وَيَرْحَمُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He punishes whom He wills, and shows mercy to whom He wills;)</span> He is the Ruler Who is in control, Who does as He wishes and judges as He wants, and there is none who can put back His judgement. None can question Him about what He does; rather it is they who will be questioned, for His is the power to create and to command, and whatever He decides is fair and just, for He is the sovereign who cannot be unjust in the slightest. According to a Hadith recorded by the Sunan compilers:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ لَوْ عَذَّبَ أَهْلَ سَمَاوَاتِهِ وَأَهْلَ أَرْضِهِ لَعَذَّبَهُمْ وَهُوَ غَيْرُ ظَالِمٍ لَهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If Allah willed to punish the dwellers of His heavens and His earth, He would do so, while He would not be unjust to them.)</span> Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُعَذِّبُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ وَيَرْحَمُ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۖ وَإِلَيْهِ تُقْلَبُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He punishes whom He wills, and shows mercy to whom He wills; and to Him you will be returned.)</span> You will return to Him on the Day of Resurrection.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا أَنْتُمْ بِمُعْجِزِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي السَّمَاءِ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And you cannot escape on the earth or in the heaven.)</span> No one in heaven or on earth can flee from Him, for He is the Subduer Who is above His servants, and everything fears Him and is in need of Him, while He is the One Who is Independent of all else.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا لَكُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مِنْ وَلِيٍّ وَلَا نَصِيرٍ - وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَلِقَائِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And besides Allah you have neither any protector nor any helper. And those who disbelieve in the Ayat of Allah and the meeting with Him,)</span> Those who disbelieved in the signs of Allah and denied the Resurrection,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُولَٰئِكَ يَئِسُوا مِنْ رَحْمَتِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(such have no hope of My mercy)</span> they will have no share in it,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and for such there is a painful torment.)</span> meaning, extremely painful, in this world and the next.</p>"
