And how excellent these companions are <span>(69)</span>Such is the bounty from Allah, and Allah is sufficient as All-Knower <span>(70)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Most People Disobey What They Are Ordered</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah states that even if the people were commanded to commit what they were prohibited from doing, most of them would not submit to this command, for their wicked nature is such that they dispute orders. Allah has complete knowledge of what has not occured, and how it would be if and when it did occur. This is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ أَنَّا كَتَبْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَنِ اقْتُلُوا أَنفُسَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if We had ordered them <span class=\"gray\">(saying)</span>, \"Kill yourselves <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. the innnocent ones kill the guilty ones)</span>)</span> until the end of the Ayah. This is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ فَعَلُوا مَا يُوعَظُونَ بِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but if they had done what they were told,)</span> meaning, if they do what they were commanded and refrain from what they were prohibited,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَّهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(it would have been better for them,)</span> than disobeying the command and committing the prohibition,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَشَدَّ تَثْبِيتًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and would have strengthened their conviction)</span>, stronger Tasdiq <span class=\"gray\">(conviction of faith)</span>, according to As-Suddi.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذًا لَّآتَيْنَاهُم مِّن لَّدُنَّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And indeed We should then have bestowed upon them from Ladunna)</span> from Us,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا</p><p lang=\"hu\" class=\"hu \"><span class=\"gray\">(A great reward)</span>, Paradise,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ صِرَاطًا مُّسْتَقِيمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And indeed We should have guided them to the straight way.)</span> in this life and the Hereafter.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Whoever Obeys Allah and His Messenger <span class=\"gray\">(ﷺ)</span> Will Be Honored by Allah</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّينَ وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّهَدَاءِ وَالصَّالِحِينَ وَحَسُنَ أُولَٰئِكَ رَفِيقًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger, then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His grace, of the Prophets, the Siddiqin, the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Consequently, whosoever implements what Allah and His Messenger ﷺ have commanded him and avoids what Allah and His Messenger ﷺ have prohibited, then Allah will grant him a dwelling in the Residence of Honor. There, Allah will place him in the company of the Prophets, and those who are lesser in grade, the true believers, then the martyrs and then the righteous, who are righteous inwardly and outwardly. Allah then praised this company,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَحَسُنَ أُولَٰئِكَ رَفِيقًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And how excellent these companions are!)</span> Al-Bukhari recorded that 'A'ishah said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا مِنْ نَبِيٍّ يَمْرَضُ إِلَّا خُيِّرَ بَيْنَ الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Every Prophet who falls ill is given the choice between this life and the Hereafter.)</span> During the illness that preceded his death, his voice became weak and I heard him saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَعَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّينَ وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّهَدَاءِ وَالصَّالِحِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His grace, the Prophets, the true believers <span class=\"gray\">(Siddiqin)</span>, the martyrs and the righteous)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">I knew then that he was being given the choice.\" Muslim recorded this Hadith.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Hadith explains the meaning of another Hadith; the Prophet ﷺ said before his death;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللَّهُمَّ (فِي) الرَّفِيقِ الْأَعْلَى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Allah! In the Most High Company)</span> three times, and he then died, may Allah's best blessings be upon him.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Reason Behind Revealing this Honorable Ayah</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Jarir recorded that Sa'id bin Jubayr said, \"An Ansari man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ while feeling sad. The Prophet ﷺ said to him, 'Why do I see you sad?' He said, 'O Allah's Prophet! I was contemplating about something.' The Prophet ﷺ said, 'What is it?' The Ansari said, 'We come to you day and night, looking at your face and sitting by you. Tomorrow, you will be raised with the Prophets, and we will not be able to see you.' The Prophet ﷺ did not say anything, but later Jibril came down to him with this Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّينَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His grace, of the Prophets)</span>, and the Prophet ﷺ sent the good news to the Ansari man.\" This Hadith was narrated in Mursal form from Masruq, 'Ikrimah, 'Amir Ash-Sha'bi, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi' bin Anas. This is the version with the best chain of narrators. Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah recorded it with a different chain from 'A'ishah, who said; \"A man came to the Prophet ﷺ and said to him, 'O Messenger of Allah! You are more beloved to me than myself, my family and children. Sometimes, when I am at home, I remember you, and I cannot wait until I come and look at you. When I contemplate about my death and your death, I know that you will be with the Prophets when you enter Paradise. I fear that I might not see you when I enter Paradise.' The Prophet ﷺ did not answer him until the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّينَ وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّهَدَاءِ وَالصَّالِحِينَ وَحَسُنَ أُولَٰئِكَ رَفِيقًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger, then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His grace, of the Prophets, the true believers, the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!)</span> was revealed to him.\" This was collected by Al-Hafiz Abu 'Abdullah Al-Maqdisi in his book, Sifat Al-Jannah, he then commented, \"I do not see problems with this chain.\" And Allah knows best. Muslim recorded that Rabi'ah bin Ka'b Al-Aslami said, \"I used to sleep at the Prophet's house and bring him his water for ablution and his needs. He once said to me, 'Ask me.' I said, 'O Messenger of Allah! I ask that I be your companion in Paradise.' He said, 'Anything except that?' I said, 'Only that.' He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَعِنِّي عَلى نَفْسِكَ بِكَثْرَةِ السُّجُودِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then help me <span class=\"gray\">(fulfill this wish)</span> for you by performing many prostrations.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that 'Amr bin Murrah Al-Juhani said, \"A man came to the Prophet ﷺ and said, 'O Allah's Messenger! I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that you are the Messenger of Allah, pray the five <span class=\"gray\">(daily prayers)</span>, give the Zakah due on my wealth and fast the month of Ramadan.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَـــنْ مَـــاتَ عَلى هَـــذَا كَانَ مَـــعَ النَّبِيِّيــنَ وَالصِّــدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّــهَدَاءِ يَـــــــــوْمَ الْقِيَـــــامَةِ، هَكَذا وَنَصَبَ أُصْبُعَيْهِ - مَا لَمْ يَعُقَّ وَالِدَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever dies in this state will be with the Prophets, the truthful and martyrs on the Day of Resurrection, as long as - and he raised his finger - he is not disobedient to his parents.)</span>\" Only Ahmad recorded this Hadith.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Greater news than this is in the authentic Hadith collected in the Sahih and Musnad compilations, in Mutawatir form, narrated by several Companions that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked about the person who loves a people, but his status is not close to theirs. The Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْمَرْءُ مَعَ مَنْ أَحَبَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(One is with those whom he loves.)</span> Anas commented, \"Muslims were never happier than with this Hadith.\" In another narration, Anas said, \"I love the Messenger of Allah, Abu Bakr and 'Umar, and I hope that Allah will resurrect me with them, even though I did not perform actions similar to theirs.\" Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَٰلِكَ الْفَضْلُ مِنَ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Such is the bounty from Allah)</span> meaning, from Allah by His mercy, for it is He who made them suitable for this, not their good deeds.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ عَلِيمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and Allah is sufficient as All-Knower)</span>, He knows those who deserve guidance and success.</p>"
