And as for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord, but as for those who disbelieve, they say: \"What did Allah intend by this parable?\" By it He misleads many, and many He guides thereby. And He misleads thereby only the Fasiqin <span class=\"gray\">(the rebellious, disobedient to Allah <span>(26)</span>Those who break Allah's covenant after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined and do mischief on earth, it is they who are the losers <span>(27)</span></span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In his Tafsir, As-Suddi reported that Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn Mas'ud, and some Companions said; \"When Allah gave these two examples of the hypocrites\" meaning Allah's statements,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِى اسْتَوْقَدَ نَاراً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوْ كَصَيِّبٍ مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or like a rainstorm from the sky)</span>, \"The hypocrites said, 'Allah's far more exalted than for Him to make such examples.'

Sa'id said that Qatadah said, \"Allah does not shy away from the truth when He mentions a matter as a parable, whether this matter is significant or not. When Allah mentioned the flies and the spider in His Book, the people of misguidance said, 'Why did Allah mention these things.' So Allah revealed;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَسْتَحْيِي أَن يَضْرِبَ مَثَلًا مَّا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah is not ashamed to set forth a parable even of a mosquito or so much more when it is bigger <span class=\"gray\">(or less when it is smaller)</span> than it)</span>.\"</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>A Parable about the Life of This World</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abu Ja'far Ar-Razi reported that Ar-Rabi' bin Anas commented on this Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:26)</span>; \"This is an example that Allah has given for the life of this world. The mosquito lives as long as it needs food, but when it gets fat, it dies. This is also the example of people whom Allah mentioned in the Qur'an: when they acquire <span class=\"gray\">(and collect the delights of)</span> the life of this world, Allah then takes them away.\" Afterwards, he recited,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَمَّا نَسُوا مَا ذُكِّرُوا بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So, when they forgot <span class=\"gray\">(the warning)</span> with which they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates of every <span class=\"gray\">(pleasant)</span> thing)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:44)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In this Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:26)</span> Allah stated that He does not shy away or hesitate in making an example or parable of anything, whether the example involves a significant or an insignificant matter.</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمَا فَوْقَهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or so much more when it is bigger than it)</span> Fama fawqaha means, something bigger than the mosquito, which is one of the most insignificant and tiniest of creatures. Muslim narrated that Aishah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا مِنْ مُسْلِمٍ يُشَاكُ شَوكَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا إِلَّا كُتِبَتْ لَهُ بِهَا دَرَجَةٌ، وَمُحِيَتْ عَنْهُ بِهَا خَطِيئَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(No Muslim is harmed by a thorn, Fama fawqaha <span class=\"gray\">(or something larger)</span>, but a good deed will be written for him and an evil deed will be erased from his record.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So Allah has informed us that there is no matter that is too small that is exempt from being used as an example, even if it was as insignificant as a mosquito or a spider.

Giving its fruit at all times, by the leave of its Lord, and Allah sets forth parables for mankind in order that they may remember. And the parable of an evil word is that of an evil tree uprooted from the surface of earth, having no stability.

And Allah will cause the Zalimin <span class=\"gray\">(polytheists and wrongdoers)</span> to go astray those and Allah does what He wills.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(14:24-27)</span>. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ضَرَبَ اللَّهُ مَثَلًا عَبْدًا مَّمْلُوكًا لَّا يَقْدِرُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah puts forward the example of <span class=\"gray\">(two men ـ a believer and a disbeliever)</span>; a servant under the possession of another, he has no power of any sort)</span><span class=\"gray\">(16:75)</span>. He then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَضَرَبَ اللَّهُ مَثَلًا رَّجُلَيْنِ أَحَدُهُمَا أَبْكَمُ لَا يَقْدِرُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ كَلٌّ عَلَىٰ مَوْلَاهُ أَيْنَمَا يُوَجِّههُّ لَا يَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ ۖ هَلْ يَسْتَوِي هُوَ وَمَن يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ ۙ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah puts forward <span class=\"gray\">(another)</span> example of two men, one of them dumb, who has no power over anything, and he is a burden on his master; whichever way he directs him, he brings no good. Is such a man equal to one who commands justice?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(16:76)</span>. Also, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ضَرَبَ لَكُم مَّثَلًا مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ ۖ هَل لَّكُم مِّن مَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُم مِّن شُرَكَاءَ فِي مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He sets forth for you a parable from your own selves: Do you have partners among those whom your right hands possess <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. your servants)</span> to share as equals in the wealth we have bestowed on you?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(30:28)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Mujahid commented on Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَسْتَحْيِي أَن يَضْرِبَ مَثَلًا مَّا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah is not ashamed to set forth a parable even of a mosquito or so much more when it is bigger than it.)</span> \"The believers believe in these parables, whether they involve large matters or small, because they know that they are the truth from their Lord, and Allah guides the believers by these parables.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In his Tafsir, As-Suddi reported that Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn Mas'ud and other people among the Companions said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُضِلُّ بِهِ كَثِيرًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By it He misleads many)</span>, \"Meaning the hypocrites. Allah guides the believers with these parables, and the straying of the hypocrites increases when they reject the parables that Allah mentioned for them which they know are true. This is how Allah misleads them.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَهْدِي بِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He guides thereby)</span> meaning, with the parables,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَثِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(many)</span> from among the people of faith and conviction. Allah adds guidance to their guidance, and faith to their faith, because they firmly believe in what they know to be true, that is, the parables that Allah has mentioned. This is guidance that Allah grants them;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا يُضِلُّ بِهِ إِلَّا الْفَاسِقِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He misleads thereby only the Fasiqin <span class=\"gray\">(the rebellious, disobedient to Allah)</span>)</span>, meaning, the hypocrites. The Arabs say that the date has Fasaqat, when it comes out of its skin, and they call the mouse a Fuwaysiqah, because it leaves its den to cause mischief. The Two Sahihs recorded 'A'ishah saying that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خَمْسٌ فَوَاسِقُ يُقْتَلْنَ فِي الْحِلِّ وَالْحَرَمِ: الغُرَابُ وَالْحِدَأَةُ وَالْعَقْرَبُ وَالْفَأْرَةُ وَالْكَلْبُ الْعَقُورُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Five animals are Fawasiq, and they must be killed during Ihram and otherwise: the crow, the kite, the scorpion, the mouse and the rabid dog.)</span> Fasiq, includes the disbeliever and the disobedient. However, the Fisq of the disbeliever is worse, and this is the type of Fasiq that the Ayah is describing here, because Allah described them as,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَاقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَا أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who break Allah's covenant after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined and do mischief on earth, it is they who are the losers.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">These are the characteristics of the disbelievers and they contradict the qualities of the believers. Similarly, Allah said in Surat Ar-Ra'd,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَمَن يَعْلَمُ أَنَّمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ الْحَقُّ كَمَنْ هُوَ أَعْمَىٰ ۚ إِنَّمَا يَتَذَكَّرُ أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ - الَّذِينَ يُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ وَلَا يَنقُضُونَ الْمِيثَاقَ - وَالَّذِينَ يَصِلُونَ مَا أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُمْ وَيَخَافُونَ سُوءَ الْحِسَابِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Shall he then, who knows that what has been revealed unto you <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad ﷺ)</span> from your Lord is the truth, be like him who is blind? But it is only the men of understanding that pay heed. Those who fulfill the covenant of Allah and break not the Mithaq <span class=\"gray\">(bond, treaty, covenant)</span>. And those who join that which Allah has commanded to be joined <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. they are good to their relatives and do not sever the bond of kinship)</span>, and fear their Lord, and dread the terrible reckoning.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(13:19-21)</span>) until,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَاقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَا أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۙ أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمُ اللَّعْنَةُ وَلَهُمْ سُوءُ الدَّارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who break the covenant of Allah, after its ratification, and sever that which Allah has commanded to be joined <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. they sever the bond of kinship and are not good to their relatives)</span>, and work mischief in the land, on them is the curse <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. they will be far away from Allah's mercy)</span>, and for them is the unhappy <span class=\"gray\">(evil)</span> home <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. Hell)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(13:25)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The covenant that these deviant people broke is Allah's covenant with His creation, that is, to obey Him and avoid the sins that He prohibited. This covenant was reiterated in Allah's Books and by the words of His Messengers. Ignoring this covenant constitutes breaking it.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was said that the Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:27)</span> is about the disbelievers and the hypocrites among the People of the Book. In this case, the covenant that they broke is the pledge that Allah took from them in the Tawrah to follow Muhammad ﷺ when he is sent as a Prophet, and to believe in him, and in what he was sent with. Breaking Allah's covenant in this case occured when the People of the Book rejected the Prophet ﷺ after they knew the truth about him, and they hid this truth from people, even though they swore to Allah that they would do otherwise. Allah informed us that they threw the covenant behind their backs and sold it for a miserable price.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was also reported that the Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:27)</span> refers to all disbelievers, idol worshippers and hypocrites. Allah took their pledge to believe in His Oneness, showing them the signs that testify to His Lordship. He also took a covenant from them to obey His commands and refrain from His prohibitions, knowing that His Messengers would bring proofs and miracles that none among the creation could ever produce. These miracles testified to the truth of Allah's Messengers. The covenant was broken when the disbelievers denied what was proven to them to be authentic and rejected Allah's Prophets and Books, although they knew that they were the truth. This Tafsir was reported from Muqatil bin Hayyan, and it is very good. It is also the view that Az-Zamakhshari held.</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement next,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَا أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And sever what Allah has ordered to be joined)</span> is in reference to keeping the relations with the relatives, as Qatadah asserted. This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَهَلْ عَسَيْتُمْ إِن تَوَلَّيْتُمْ أَن تُفْسِدُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَتُقَطِّعُوا أَرْحَامَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(47:22)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Jarir At-Tabari preferred this opinion. However, it has been said that the meaning of the Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:27)</span> here is more general. Hence, everything that Allah has commanded to nurture, and the people severed, is included in its meaning.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Meaning of 'Loss'</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Muqatil bin Hayyan commented on Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is they who are the losers)</span> \"In the Hereafter.\" Similarly, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمُ اللَّعْنَةُ وَلَهُمْ سُوءُ الدَّارِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On them is the curse <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. they will be far away from Allah's mercy)</span>, and for them is the unhappy <span class=\"gray\">(evil)</span> home <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. Hell)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">(13:25)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Also, Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"Every characteristic that Allah describes those other than the people of Islam - such as being losers - then it refers to disbelief. However, when they are attributed to the people of Islam, then these terms refer to sin.\" Ibn Jarir commented on Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is they who are the losers,)</span> \"Losers is plural for loser, this word refers to whoever decreased his own share of Allah's mercy by disobeying Him, just as the merchant loses in his trade by sustaining capital loss. Such is the case with the hypocrite and the disbeliever who lose their share of the mercy that Allah has in store for His servants on the Day of Resurrection. And that is when the disbeliever and the hypocrite most desperately need Allah's mercy.\"</p>"
