    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Have you not seen how your Lord spread the shadow.

Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ كَيْفَ مَدَّ الظِّلَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Have you not seen how your Lord spread the shadow.)</span> Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn 'Umar, Abu Al-'Aliyah, Abu Malik, Masruq, Mujahid, Sa'id bin Jubayr, An-Nakha'i, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others said, \"This refers to the period from the beginning of the dawn until the sun rises.\"</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">وَلَوْ شَاءَ لَجَعَلَهُ سَاكِنًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If He willed, He could have made it still)</span> meaning, immobile, never changing. This is like the Ayat:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن جَعَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمُ اللَّيْلَ سَرْمَدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say : \"Tell me! If Allah made the night continuous for you...\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(28:71)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا الشَّمْسَ عَلَيْهِ دَلِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but We have made the sun its guide.)</span> means, were it not for the sun rising, it would not be there, for a thing can only be known in contrast to its opposite. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"The sun is a guide which follows the shade until the shade disappears. \"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ قَبَضْنَاهُ إِلَيْنَا قَبْضًا يَسِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then We withdraw it towards Ourselves – a gradual withdrawal.)</span> This refers to the shade.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَسِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(gradual)</span> meaning slowly. As-Suddi said: \"A gentle, concealed, withdrawal until there is no shade left on earth except under a roof or a tree, and the sun is shining on whatever is above it.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَبْضًا يَسِيرًا</p><p lang=\"cy\" class=\"cy \"><span class=\"gray\">(a gradual withdrawal.)</span> Ayyub bin Musa said: \"Little by little.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ اللَّيْلَ لِبَاسًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And it is He Who makes the night a covering for you,)</span> It covers and conceals all things. This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By the night as it envelops)</span><span class=\"gray\">(92:1)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالنَّوْمَ سُبَاتًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and the sleep a repose,)</span> means, a halt to movement so that bodies may rest. For the faculties and limbs get tired from their constant movement during the day when one goes out to earn a living. When night comes, and it becomes quiet, they stop moving, and rest; so sleep provides a rejuvenation for both the body and the soul.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَعَلَ النَّهَارَ نُشُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and makes the day Nushur)</span> meaning, people get up and go out to earn a living and attend to their business. This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمِن رَّحْمَتِهِ جَعَلَ لَكُمُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ لِتَسْكُنُوا فِيهِ وَلِتَبْتَغُوا مِن فَضْلِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is out of His mercy that He has made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and that you may seek of His bounty...)</span><span class=\"gray\">(28:73)</span></p>"

    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy; and We send down pure water from the sky <span>(48)</span>That We may give life thereby to a dead land, and We give to drink thereof many of the cattle and men that We have created <span>(49)</span>And indeed We have distributed it among them in order that they may remember the grace of Allah, but most men refuse <span class=\"gray\">(out of)</span> gratitude <span>(50)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>This is also part of His complete power and supreme authority:</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, i.e., they bring the clouds behind them. The winds are of many different types, depending on the purpose for which they are sent. Some of them form the clouds, others carry the clouds or drive them, and others come ahead of the clouds as heralds announcing their coming. Some of them come before that to stir up the earth, and some of them fertilize or \"seed\" the clouds to make it rain. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً طَهُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and We send down pure water from the sky)</span>, meaning, as a means of purifying it. Abu Sa'id said, \"It was said: \"O Messenger of Allah, can we perform Wudu' with the water of the well of Buda'ah For it is a well in which rubbish and the flesh of dogs are thrown. He said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الْمَاءَ طَهُورٌ لَا يُنَجِّسُهُ شَيْءٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Water is pure and nothing makes it impure.)</span> This was recorded by Ash-Shafi'i and Ahmad, who graded it Sahih, and also by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Hasan, and by An-Nasa'i. His saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِّنُحْيِيَ بِهِ بَلْدَةً مَّيْتًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That We may give life thereby to a dead land,)</span> means, a land that waited a long time for rain. It is devoid of vegetation or anything at all. When the rain comes to it, it becomes alive and its hills are covered with all kinds of colorful flowers, as Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِذَا أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَاءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but when We send down water to it, it is stirred to life and growth...)</span><span class=\"gray\">(41:39)</span>. His saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَنُسْقِيَهُ مِمَّا خَلَقْنَا أَنْعَامًا وَأَنَاسِيَّ كَثِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and We give to drink thereof many of the cattle and men that We had created.)</span> means, so that animals such as cattle can drink from it, and people who are in desperate need of water can drink from it and water their crops and fruits. This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ الَّذِي يُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا قَنَطُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired,)</span><span class=\"gray\">(42:28)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَانظُرْ إِلَىٰ آثَارِ رَحْمَتِ اللَّهِ كَيْفَ يُحْيِي الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Look then at the effects of Allah's mercy, how He revives the earth after its death.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(30:50)</span> His saying:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَاهُ بَيْنَهُمْ لِيَذَّكَّرُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And indeed We have distributed it among them in order that they may remember)</span> means, 'We cause rain to fall on this land and not on that, and We cause the clouds to pass over one land and go to another, where We cause sufficient rain to fall so that its people have plenty, but not one drop falls on the first land.' There is a reason and great wisdom behind this. Ibn 'Abbas and Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with them said: \"One year does not have more rain than another, but Allah distributes the rain as He wills. Then he recited this Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَاهُ بَيْنَهُمْ لِيَذَّكَّرُوا فَأَبَىٰ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ إِلَّا كُفُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And indeed We have distributed it <span class=\"gray\">(rain or water)</span> amongst them in order that they may remember the grace of Allah, but most men refuse <span class=\"gray\">(out of)</span> ingratitude.)</span>\" meaning, so that they may be reminded, when Allah brings the dead earth back to life, that He is able to bring the dead and dry bones back to life, or that those from whom rain is withheld are suffering this because of some sin they have committed, so that they may give it up.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَبَىٰ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ إِلَّا كُفُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but most men refuse <span class=\"gray\">(out of)</span> ingratitude.)</span> 'Ikrimah said, \"This refers to those who say that rain comes because of such and such a star.\" This view of 'Ikrimah is similar to the authentic Hadith recorded in Sahih Muslim; one day after a night's rain, the Messenger of Allah said to his Companions:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَتَدْرُونَ مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّكُمْ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do you know what your Lord says)</span> They said: \"Allah and His Messenger know best.\" He said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ: أَصْبَحَ مِنْ عِبَادِي مُؤْمِنٌ بِي وَكَافِرٌ، فَأَمَّا مَنْ قَالَ: مُطِرْنَا بِفَضْلِ اللهِ وَرَحْمَتِهِ فَذَاكَ مُؤْمِنٌ بِي، كَافِرٌ بِالْكَوْكَبِ، وَأَمَّا مَنْ قَالَ: مُطِرْنَا بِنَوْءِ كَذَا وَكَذَا، فَذَاكَ كَافِرٌ بِي، مُؤْمِنٌ بِالْكَوْكَبِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He says: \"This morning some of My servants became believers in Me, and some became disbelievers. As for the one who said, 'We have been given rain by the mercy and grace of Allah,' he is a believer in Me and a disbeliever in the stars. As for the one who said, 'We have been given rain by such and such a star,' he is a disbeliever in Me and a believer in the stars.\")</span></p>"
