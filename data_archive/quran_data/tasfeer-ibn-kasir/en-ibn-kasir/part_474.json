Whosoever earns evil and his sin has surrounded him, they are dwellers of the Fire <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. Hell)</span>; they will dwell therein forever <span>(81)</span>And those who believe and do righteous good deeds, they are dwellers of Paradise, they will dwell therein forever <span>(82)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah says, the matter is not as you have wished and hoped it to be. Rather, whoever does an evil deed and abides purposefully in his error, coming on the Day of Resurrection with no good deeds, only evil deeds, then he will be among the people of the Fire.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who believe and do righteous good deeds)</span> meaning, \"They believe in Allah and His Messenger ﷺ and perform the good deeds that conform with the Islamic Law. They shall be among the people of Paradise.\" Allah said in a similar statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّيْسَ بِأَمَانِيِّكُمْ وَلَا أَمَانِيِّ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ مَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءًا يُجْزَ بِهِ وَلَا يَجِدْ لَهُ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا - وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِنَ الصَّالِحَاتِ مِن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُولَٰئِكَ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ وَلَا يُظْلَمُونَ نَقِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It will not be in accordance with your desires <span class=\"gray\">(Muslims)</span>, nor those of the People of the Scripture <span class=\"gray\">(Jews and Christians)</span>, whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof, and he will not find any protector or helper besides Allah. And whoever does righteous good deeds, male or female, and is a <span class=\"gray\">(true)</span> believer <span class=\"gray\">[in the Oneness of Allah <span class=\"gray\">(Muslim)</span>]</span>, such will enter Paradise and not the least injustice, even the size of a Naqira <span class=\"gray\">(speck on the back of a date stone)</span>, will be done to them)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:123-124)</span>.</p><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">Also, Abu Hurayrah, Abu Wa'il, 'Ata', and Al-Hasan said that,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَحَاطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيئَتُهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And his sin has surrounded him)</span> means, \"His Shirk <span class=\"gray\">(polytheism)</span> has surrounded him.\" Also, Al-A'mash reported from Abu Razin that Ar-Rabi' bin Khuthaym said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَحَاطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيئَتُهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And his sin has surrounded him)</span>, \"Whoever dies before repenting from his wrongs.\" As-Suddi and Abu Razin said similarly. Abu Al-'Aliyah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi' bin Anas said that,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَحَاطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيئَتُهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And his sin has surrounded him)</span> refers to major sins. All of these statements carry similar meanings, and Allah knows best.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>When Small Sins gather, They bring about Destruction</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Here we should mention the Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded, in which 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِيَّاكُمْ وَمُحَقَّرَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ فَإِنَّهُنَّ يَجْتَمِعْنَ عَلَى الرَّجُلِ حَتّى يُهْلِكْنَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Beware of the belittled sins, because they gather on a person until they destroy him.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He then said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave them an example,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَمَثَلٍ قَوْمٍ نَزَلُوا بِأَرْضِ فَلَاةٍ، فَحَضَرَ صَنِيعُ الْقَوْمِ فَجَعَلَ الرَّجُلُ يَنْطَلِقُ فَيَجِيءُ بِالْعُودِ وَالرَّجُلُ يَجِيءُ بِالْعُودِ، حَتّى جَمَعُوا سَوَادًا وَأَجَّجُوا نَارًا فَأَنْضَجُوا مَا قَذَفُوا فِيهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(This is the example of people who set up camp on a flat land, and then their servants came.

Then you slid back, except a few of you, while you are backsliders <span>(83)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Covenant that Allah took from the Children of Israel</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah reminded the Children of Israel of the commandments that He gave them, and the covenants that He took from them to abide by those commands, and how they intentionally and knowingly turned away from all of that. Allah commanded them to worship Him and to associate none with Him in worship, just as He has commanded all of His creatures, for this is why Allah created them. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلَّا نُوحِي إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَاعْبُدُونِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We did not send any Messenger before you <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad ﷺ)</span> but We revealed to him <span class=\"gray\">(saying)</span>: La ilaha illa Ana <span class=\"gray\">[none has the right to be worshipped but I <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span>]</span>, so worship Me <span class=\"gray\">(alone and none else)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">(21:25)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah <span class=\"gray\">(community, nation)</span> a Messenger <span class=\"gray\">(proclaiming)</span>: \"Worship Allah <span class=\"gray\">(alone)</span>, and avoid the Taghut <span class=\"gray\">(all false deities,)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">(16:36)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the highest and most important right, that is, Allah's right that He be worshipped alone without partners.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">After that comes the right of the creatures, foremost, the right of the parents. Allah usually mentions the rights of the parents along with His rights. For instance, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> أَنِ اشْكُرْ لِي وَلِوَالِدَيْكَ إِلَيَّ الْمَصِيرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination)</span><span class=\"gray\">(31:14)</span>. Also, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَضَىٰ رَبُّكَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents)</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:23)</span>, until,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَآتِ ذَا الْقُرْبَىٰ حَقَّهُ وَالْمِسْكِينَ وَابْنَ السَّبِيلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And give to the kinsman his due and to the Miskin <span class=\"gray\">(poor)</span> and to the wayfarer)</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:26)</span>.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">The Two Sahihs record that Ibn Mas'ud said,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">قُلْتُ:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ أيُّ الْعَمَل أَفْضَلُ؟</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ: الصَّلَاةُ عَلى وَقْتِهَا</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْتُ: ثُمَّ أَيٌّ؟</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ: بِرُّ الْوَالِدَيْنِ</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْتُ: ثُمَّ أَيٌّ؟</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَالَ: الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I said, 'O Messenger of Allah! What is the best deed?' He said, 'Performing the prayer on time.' I said, 'Then what?' He said, 'Being kind to one's parents.' I said, 'Then what?' He said, 'Jihad in the cause of Allah.')</span></p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْيَتَامَىٰ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and to orphans)</span> meaning, the young who have no fathers to fend for them.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْمَسَاكِينِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and Al-Masakin <span class=\"gray\">(the poor)</span>)</span>, plural for Miskin, the one who does not find what he needs to spend on himself and his family. We will discuss these categories when we explain the Ayah of Surat An-Nisa' where Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Worship Allah and join none with Him <span class=\"gray\">(in worship)</span>; and do good to parents)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:36)</span>.</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقُولُوا لِلنَّاسِ حُسْنًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and speak good to people)</span> meaning, say good words to them and be lenient with them, this includes commanding good and forbidding evil. Al-Hasan Al-Basri commented on Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقُولُوا لِلنَّاسِ حُسْنًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and speak good to people)</span>, \"The good saying' means commanding good and forbidding evil, and being patient and forgiving. The 'good words to people', as Allah commanded, also includes every good type of behavior that Allah is pleased with.\" Imam Ahmad narrated that Abu Dharr said that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا تَحْقِرَنَّ مِنَ الْمَعْرُوفِ شَيْئًا وَإِنْ لَمْ تَجِدْ فَالْقَ أَخَاكَ بِوَجْهٍ مُنْطَلِقٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do not belittle any form of righteousness, and even if you did not find any good deed except meeting your brother with a smiling face, then do so.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Hadith was also collected by Muslim in his Sahih and At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah commands the servants to say good words to people, after He commanded them to be kind to them, thereby mentioning two categories of manners: good speech and good actions. He then emphasized the command to worship Him and the command to do good, ordaining the prayer and the Zakah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and perform As-Salah and give Zakah)</span>. Allah informed us that the People of the Book, except for a few among them, ignored these orders, that is, they knowingly and intentionally abandoned them. Allah ordered this Ummah similarly in Surat An-Nisa' when He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا وَبِذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينِ وَالْجَارِ ذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْجَارِ الْجُنُبِ وَالصَّاحِبِ بِالْجَنبِ وَابْنِ السَّبِيلِ وَمَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ مَن كَانَ مُخْتَالًا فَخُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Worship Allah and join none with Him <span class=\"gray\">(in worship)</span>; and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, Al-Masakin <span class=\"gray\">(the poor)</span>, the neighbor who is near of kin, the neighbor who is a stranger, the companion by your side, the wayfarer <span class=\"gray\">(you meet)</span>, and those <span class=\"gray\">(servants)</span> whom your right hands possess. Verily, Allah does not like such as are proud and boastful)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:36)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Of these orders, this Ummah has practiced what no other nation before it has, and all praise is due to Allah.</p>"
