    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And those who had Taqwa will be led to Paradise in groups till when they reach it, and its gates will be opened and its keepers will say: \"Salam 'Alaykum <span class=\"gray\">(peace be upon you)</span>! You have done well, so enter here to abide therein forever. <span>(73)</span>And they will say: \"All the praises and thanks be to Allah Who has fulfilled His promise to us and has made us inherit the land. We can dwell in Paradise where we will; how excellent a reward for the workers! <span>(74)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Believers will be taken to Paradise </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Here Allah tells us about the blessed believers, who will be taken to Paradise in groups, one group after another, starting with the best of them: those who are closest to Allah, then the most righteous, then the next best and the next best. Each group will be with others like them, Prophets with Prophets, the true believers with their peers, the martyrs with their counterparts, the scholars with their colleagues, every group composed of people of the same kind.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءُوهَا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(till when they reach it,)</span> means, when they arrive at the gates of Paradise, after passing over the Sirat, where they will be detained on a bridge between Paradise and Hell, and any injustices that existed between them in this world will be settled until they have all been purified from sin through this trial. Then permission will be granted for them to enter Paradise. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was recorded in the Hadith about the Trumpet that when the believers reach the gates of Paradise, they will consult one another as to who should ask permission for them to enter. They will ask Adam, then Nuh, then Ibrahim, then Musa, then 'Isa, then Muhammad <span class=\"gray\">(may blessings and peace be upon them all)</span>. This is akin to what will happen in the arena of judgement, when they will ask for someone to intercede for them with Allah when He comes to pass judgement. This is to show the noble position of Muhammad ﷺ above the rest of mankind in all situations. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In Sahih Muslim, it is reported that Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنَا أَوَّلُ شَفِيعٍ فِي الْجَنَّةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I will be the first intercessor in Paradise.)</span> According to the wording of Muslim:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ مَنْ يَقْرَعُ بَابَ الْجَنَّةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I will be the first one to knock at the gates of Paradise.)</span> Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">آتِي بَابَ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَأَسْتَفْتِحُ فَيَقُولُ الْخَازِنُ: مَنْ أَنْتَ؟ فَأَقُولُ: مُحَمَّدٌ - قَالَ: - فَيَقُولُ: بِكَ أُمِرْتُ أَنْ لَا أَفْتَحَ لِأَحَدٍ قَبْلَكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I will come to the gate of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection and will ask for it to be opened. The gatekeeper will say, \"Who are you\" I will say \"Muhammad.\" He will say, \"I was told about you and that I was not to open the gate for anyone before you.\")</span>\" It was also recorded by Muslim. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ تَلِجُ الْجَنَّـةَ، صُوَرُهُمْ عَلَىٰ صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، لَا يَبْصُقُونَ فِيهَا، وَلَا يَمْتَخِطُونَ فِيهَا، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ فِيهَا، آنِيَتُهُمْ وَأَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ وَالْفِضَّةُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدٍ مِنْهُمْ زَوْجَتَانِ، يُرَىٰ مُخُّ سَاقِهِمَا مِنْ وَرَاءِ اللَّحْمِ مِنَ الْحُسْنِ، لَا اخْتِلَافَ بَيْنَهُمْ وَلَا تَبَاغُضَ، قُلُوبُهُمْ عَلىٰ قَلْبٍ وَاحِدٍ، يُسَبِّحُونَ اللهَ تَعَالَىٰ بُكْرَةً وَعَشِيًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The first group to enter Paradise will enter looking like the moon on the night when it is full. They will not spit there, or blow their noses, or defecate. Their vessels and combs will be of gold and silver, their censers will be of aloeswood and their sweat will be musk. Each of them will have two wives, the marrow of whose shin bones will be visible from beneath the skin because of their beauty. There will be no disputes between them and there will be no hatred; their hearts will be as if one heart. They will glorify Allah morning and evening.)</span>\" This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Hafiz Abu Ya'la recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوَّلُ زُمْرَةٍ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ عَلىٰ صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَالَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ عَلىٰ ضَوْءِ أَشَدِّ كَوْكَبٍ دُرِّيٍّ فِي السَّمَاءِ إِضَاءَةً، لَا يَبُولُونَ، وَلَا يَتَغَوَّطُونَ، وَلَا يَتْفِلُونَ، وَلَا يَمْتَخِطُونَ، أَمْشَاطُهُمُ الذَّهَبُ، وَرَشْحُهُمُ الْمِسْكُ، وَمَجَامِرُهُمُ الْأَلُوَّةُ، وَأَزْوَاجُهُمُ الْحُورُ الْعِينُ، أَخْلَاقُهُمْ عَلىٰ خُلُقِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ، عَلىٰ صُورَةِ أَبِيهِمْ آدَمَ، سِتُّونَ ذِرَاعًا فِي السَّمَاءِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The first group to enter Paradise will look like the moon on the night when it is full. They will be followed by a group which looks like the brightest star shining in the sky. They will not urinate or defecate or spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold, their sweat will be musk and their censers will be of aloeswood. Their wives will be Al-Hur Al-'Iyn, and they will all look the same, as if they are one person in the image of their father Adam, sixty cubits tall.)</span>\" They <span class=\"gray\">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</span> also produced this from the Hadith of Jabir. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was reported that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَدْخُلُ الْجَنَّةَ مِنْ أُمَّتِي زُمْرَةٌ، هُمْ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا،تُضِيءُ وُجُوهُهُمْ إِضَاءَةَ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(A group of my Ummah, seventy thousand, will enter Paradise with their faces shining like the moon on the night when it is full.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ukkashah bin Mihsan stood up and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to make me one of them.' He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Allah, make him one of them.)</span> Then one of the Ansar stood up and said, 'O Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to make me one of them.' He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَةُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Ukkashah has beaten you to it.)</span>\" This was recorded by <span class=\"gray\">(Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</span>. This Hadith – about the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without being brought to account – was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Jabir bin 'Abdullah, 'Imran bin Husayn, Ibn Mas'ud, Rifa'ah bin 'Arabah Al-Juhani and Umm Qays bint Mihsan – may Allah be pleased with them all – and also from Abu Hazim from Sahl bin Sa'd, may Allah be pleased with them, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَيَدْخُلَنَّ الْجَنَّةَ مِنْ أُمَّتِي سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا - أَوْ سَبْعُمِائَةِ أَلْفٍ - آخِذٌ بَعْضُهُمْ بِبَعْضٍ، حَتّٰى يَدْخُلَ أَوَّلُهُمْ وَآخِرُهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ، وُجُوهُهُمْ عَلىٰ صُورَةِ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Seventy thousand or seven hundred thousand of my Ummah will surely enter Paradise, holding on to one another, such that the first and last of them will enter Paradise together, with their faces looking like the moon on the night when it is full.)</span>\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءُوهَا وَفُتِحَتْ أَبْوَابُهَا وَقَالَ لَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ طِبْتُمْ فَادْخُلُوهَا خَالِدِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(till when they reach it, and its gates will be opened and its keepers will say: \"Salam 'Alaykum <span class=\"gray\">(peace be upon you)</span>! You have done well, so enter here to abide therein forever.\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is a conditional sentence that is not complete. What it implies is that when they come to the gates of Paradise the gates will be opened for them as a sign of honor, and the angelic gatekeepers will meet them with glad tidings, greetings of peace and praise. Unlike the gatekeepers of Hell who will meet the disbelievers with rebuke and reprimand, the believers will be filled with happiness and joy, each according to his degree of luxury and delights. What happens after this is not mentioned; it is left for the imagination to think of its dearest wishes and be filled with hope. It is known from the Sahih Hadiths that Paradise has eight gates.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ أَنْفَقَ زَوْجَيْنِ مِنْ مَالِهِ فِي سَبِيلِ اللهِ تَعَالَىٰ دُعِيَ مِنْ أَبْوَابِ الْجَنَّةِ، وَلِلْجَنَّةِ أَبْوَابٌ، فَمَنْ كَانَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الصَّلَاةِ دُعِيَ مِنْ بَابِ الصَّلَاةِ، وَمَنْ كَانَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الصَّدَقَةِ دُعِيَ مِنْ بَابِ الصَّدَقَةِ، وَمَنْ كَانَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْجِهَادِ دُعِيَ مِنْ بَابِ الْجِهَادِ، وَمَنْ كَانَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الصِّيَامِ دُعِيَ مِنْ بَابِ الرَّيَّانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever spends a pair of something from his wealth for the sake of Allah, will be called from the gates of Paradise. Paradise has <span class=\"gray\">(several)</span> gates. Whoever is among the people of prayer, will be called from the gate of Prayer; whoever is among the people of charity, will be called from the gate of Charity; whoever is among the people of Jihad, will be called from the gate of Jihad; whoever is among the people of fasting, will be called from the Gate of Ar-Rayyan.)</span>\" Abu Bakr said, 'O Messenger of Allah, it does not matter from which gate one is called, but will anyone be called from all of them?' He ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">نَعَمْ، وَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونَ مِنْهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yes, and I hope that you will be one of them.)</span>\" Something similar was also recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was reported from Sahl bin Sa'd, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ ثَمَانِيَةَ أَبْوَابٍ، بَابٌ مِنْهَا يُسَمَّى الرَّيَّانَ، لَا يَدْخُلُهُ إِلَّا الصَّائِمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In Paradise there are eight gates; one of them is called Ar-Rayyan, and no one will enter it except those who fast.)</span>\" In Sahih Muslim, it is recorded that 'Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ يَتَوَضَّأُ فَيُبْلِغُ - أَوْ فَيُسْبِغُ - الْوُضُوءَ، ثُمَّ يَقُولُ: أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ، إِلَّا فُتِحَتْ لَهُ أَبْوَابُ الْجَنَّةِ الثَّمَانِيَةُ، يَدْخُلُ مِنْ أَيِّهَا شَاءَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is no one among you who performs Wudu' and does it well, or – amply –, then he says: \"I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, \" but the eight gates of Paradise will be opened for him and he will enter through whichever one he wishes.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Width of the Gates of Paradise</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">We ask Allah to make us among its people. In the Two Sahihs, it is reported from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, in the lengthy Hadith about intercession <span class=\"gray\">(that the Prophet ﷺ said)</span>:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَىٰ: يَا مُحَمَّدُ، أَدْخِلْ مَنْ لَا حِسَابَ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أُمَّتِكَ مِنَ الْبَابِ الْأَيْمَنِ، وَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ النَّاسِ فِي الْأَبْوَابِ الأُخَرِ، وَالَّذِي نَفْسُ مُحَمَّدٍ بِيَدِهِ! إِنَّ مَا بَيْنَ الْمِصْرَاعَيْنِ مِنْ مَصَارِيعِ الْجَنَّةِ - مَا بَيْنَ عِضَادَتَيِ الْبَابِ - لَكَمَا بَيْنَ مَكَّةَ وَهَجَرٍ - أَوْ هَجَرٍ وَمَكَّةَ - وفي رواية مَكَّةَ وَبُصْرَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah will say: \"O Muhammad, admit those of your Ummah who are not to be brought to account, through the right-hand gate, and they will be counted among those who will enter from other gates as well.\" By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, the distance between the two gateposts of the gates of Paradise is like the distance between Makkah and Hajar – or Hajar and Makkah.)</span>\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">According to another report: <span class=\"gray\">(between Makkah and Busra.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was recorded in Sahih Muslim from 'Utbah bin Ghazwan that <span class=\"gray\">(the Prophet ﷺ)</span> gave them a speech in which he told them that the distance between the two gateposts of Paradise was the distance of a forty-year journey, but there would come a day when they would be packed with crowds of people. Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالَ لَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ طِبْتُمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and its keepers will say: \"Salam 'Alaykum <span class=\"gray\">(peace be upon you)</span>!

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ issued commands during some of his military campaigns that it should be shouted out to the Muslims:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ لَا يَدْخُلُهَا إِلَّا نَفْسٌ مُسْلِمَةٌ - وفي رواية - مُؤْمِنَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(No one enters Paradise except a Muslim soul)</span> or, according to one report, <span class=\"gray\">(A believing soul.)</span>\" Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَادْخُلُوهَا خَالِدِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so enter here to abide therein forever.)</span> means, to dwell therein, never seeking any change.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي صَدَقَنَا وَعْدَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they will say: \"All the praises and thanks be to Allah Who has fulfilled His promise to us...\")</span> means, when the believers see the great reward and splendors, blessing and grand generosity, they will say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي صَدَقَنَا وَعْدَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(All the praises and thanks be to Allah Who has fulfilled His promise to us)</span> meaning, 'the promise which He made to us through His Messengers who called us to this in the world.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبَّنَا وَآتِنَا مَا وَعَدْتَنَا عَلَىٰ رُسُلِكَ وَلَا تُخْزِنَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۗ إِنَّكَ لَا تُخْلِفُ الْمِيعَادَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Our Lord!
