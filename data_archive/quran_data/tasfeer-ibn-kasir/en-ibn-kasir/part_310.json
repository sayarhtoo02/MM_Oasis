This was the view of more than one of the Salaf: Ibn 'Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka'b, Qatadah, 'Atiyyah Al-'Awfi, As-Suddi, Ad-Dahhak, Az-Zuhri and Ibn Jurayj. This is an issue concerning which there is no dispute. Az-Zuhri said, \"This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ مَن كَانَ عَدُوًّا لِّجِبْرِيلَ فَإِنَّهُ نَزَّلَهُ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"Whoever is an enemy to Jibril – for indeed he has brought it down to your heart by Allah's permission, confirming what came before it...\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:97)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Upon your heart)</span> 'O Muhammad, free from any contamination, with nothing added or taken away.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِتَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُنذِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that you may be of the warners,)</span> means, 'so that you may warn people with it of the punishment of Allah for those who go against it and disbelieve in it, and so that you may give glad tidings with it to the believers who follow it.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِيٍّ مُّبِينٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In the plain Arabic language.)</span> meaning, 'this Qur'an which We have revealed to you, We have revealed in perfect and eloquent Arabic, so that it may be quite clear, leaving no room for excuses and establishing clear proof, showing the straight path.'</p>"

    "text": "<p class=\"en translation\" lang=\"en\">And verily, it is in the Zubur of the former people <span>(196)</span>Is it not a sign to them that the learned scholars of the Children of Israel knew it <span>(197)</span>And if We had revealed it unto any of the non-Arabs <span>(198)</span>And he had recited it unto them, they would not have believed in it <span>(199)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Qur'an Was Mentioned in the Previous Scriptures</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah says: this Qur'an was mentioned and referred to in the previous Scriptures that were left behind by their Prophets who foretold it in ancient times and more recently. Allah took a covenant from them that they would follow it, and the last of them stood and addressed his people with the good news of Ahmad:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيَّ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَمُبَشِّرًا بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِي مِن بَعْدِي اسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And <span class=\"gray\">(remember)</span> when 'Isa, son of Maryam, said: \"O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you, confirming the Tawrah before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(61:6)</span> Zubur here refers to Books; Zubur is the plural of Az-Zabur, which is also the name used to refer to the Book given to Dawud. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكُلُّ شَيْءٍ فَعَلُوهُ فِي الزُّبُرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And everything they have done is noted in the Az-Zubur.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(54:52)</span>, meaning, it is recorded against them in the books of the angels. Then Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُمْ آيَةً أَن يَعْلَمَهُ عُلَمَاءُ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Is it not a sign to them that the learned scholars of the Children of Israel knew it?)</span> meaning, is it not sufficient witness to the truth for them that the scholars of the Children of Israel found this Qur'an mentioned in the Scriptures which they study The meaning is: the fair-minded among them admitted that the attributes of Muhammad ﷺ and his mission and his Ummah were mentioned in their Books, as was stated by those among them who believed, such as 'Abdullah bin Salam, Salman Al-Farisi and others who met the Prophet ﷺ. Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ الرَّسُولَ النَّبِيَّ الْأُمِّيَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write...)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7:157)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Intense Disbelief of Quraysh</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah tells us how intense the disbelief of Quraysh was, and how stubbornly they resisted the Qur'an. If this Book with all its eloquence had been revealed to a non-Arab who did not know one word of Arabic, they still would not have believed in him. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ نَزَّلْنَاهُ عَلَىٰ بَعْضِ الْأَعْجَمِينَ - فَقَرَأَهُ عَلَيْهِم مَّا كَانُوا بِهِ مُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if We had revealed it unto any of the non-Arabs, And he had recited it unto them, they would not have believed in it.)</span> And Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَابًا مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ فَظَلُّوا فِيهِ يَعْرُجُونَ - لَقَالُوا إِنَّمَا سُكِّرَتْ أَبْصَارُنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And even if We opened to them a gate from the heaven and they were to keep on ascending thereto. They would surely say: \"Our eyes have been dazzled...\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(15:14-15)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ أَنَّنَا نَزَّلْنَا إِلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَائِكَةَ وَكَلَّمَهُمُ الْمَوْتَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And even if We had sent down unto them angels, and the dead had spoken unto them...)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:111)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Truly, those, against whom the Word of your Lord has been justified, will not believe.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(10:96)</span></p>"
