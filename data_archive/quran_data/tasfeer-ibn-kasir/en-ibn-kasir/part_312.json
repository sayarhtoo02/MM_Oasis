Then Allah commands His Messenger ﷺ to warn his tribe of near kindred, i.e., those who were most closely related to him, and to tell them that nothing could save any of them except for faith in Allah. Allah also commanded him to be kind and gentle with the believing servants of Allah who followed him, and to disown those who disobeyed him, no matter who they were. Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِنْ عَصَوْكَ فَقُلْ إِنِّي بَرِيءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then if they disobey you, say: \"I am innocent of what you do.\")</span> This specific warning does not contradict the general warning; indeed it is a part of it, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِتُنذِرَ قَوْمًا مَّا أُنذِرَ آبَاؤُهُمْ فَهُمْ غَافِلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In order that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are heedless.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(36:6)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِّتُنذِرَ أُمَّ الْقُرَىٰ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that you may warn the Mother of the Towns and all around it)</span><span class=\"gray\">(42:7)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنذِرْ بِهِ الَّذِينَ يَخَافُونَ أَن يُحْشَرُوا إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And warn therewith those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:51)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنذِرَ بِهِ قَوْمًا لُّدًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa, and warn with it the most quarrelsome people.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(19:97)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> لِأُنذِرَكُم بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:19)</span>, and</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الْأَحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11:17)</span>.</p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">According to Sahih Muslim, <span class=\"gray\">[the Prophet ﷺ said:]</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَا نَصْرَانِيٌّ، ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِي إِلَّا دَخَلَ النَّارَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, no one from these nations – Jewish or Christian – hears of me then does not believe in me, but he will enter Hell.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Many Hadiths have been narrated concerning the revelation of this Ayah, some of which we will quote below:</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \"When Allah revealed the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الْأَقْرَبِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And warn your tribe of near kindred.)</span>, the Prophet ﷺ went to As-Safa', climbed up and called out,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا صَبَاحَاهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O people!)</span> The people gathered around him, some coming of their own accord and others sending people on their behalf to find out what was happening. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا بَنِي عَبْدِ الْمُطَّلِبِ، يَا بَنِي فِهْرٍ، يَااَبنِي لُؤَيٍّ، أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلًا بِسَفْحِ هَذَا الْجَبَلِ تُريدُ أَنْ تُغِيرَ عَلَيْكُمْ صَدَّقْتُمُونِي؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Bani 'Abd Al-Muttalib, O Bani Fihr, O Bani Lu'ayy!

Imam Ahmad recorded that Qabisah bin Mukhariq and Zuhayr bin 'Amr said: \"When the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الْأَقْرَبِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And warn your tribe of near kindred.)</span> was revealed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ climbed on top of a rock on the side of a mountain and started to call out:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا بَنِي عَبْدِ مَنَافٍ، إِنَّمَا أَنَا نَذِيرٌ، وَإِنَّمَا مَثَلِي وَمَثَلُكُمْ كَرَجُلٍ رَأَى الْعَدُوَّ فَذَهَبَ يَرْبَأُ أَهْلَهُ يَخْشَى أَنْ يَسْبِقُوهُ، فَجَعَلَ يُنَادِي وَيَهْتِفُ: يَا صَبَاحَاهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Bani 'Abd Manaf, I am indeed a warner, and the parable of me and you is that of a man who sees the enemy so he goes to save his family, fearing that the enemy may reach them before he does.)</span> And he started to call out, <span class=\"gray\">(O people!)</span> It was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. Allah's saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى الْعَزِيزِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful,)</span> means, 'in all your affairs, for He is your Helper, Protector and Supporter, and He is the One Who will cause you to prevail and will make your word supreme.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِي يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who sees you when you stand up.)</span> means, He is taking care of you. This is like the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So wait patiently for the decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes)</span><span class=\"gray\">(52:48)</span> Ibn 'Abbas said that the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِي يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who sees you when you stand up.)</span> means, \"To pray.\" 'Ikrimah said: \"He sees him when he stands and bows and prostrates.\" Al-Hasan said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِي يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who sees you when you stand up.)</span> \"When you pray alone.\" Ad-Dahhak said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِي يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who sees you when you stand up.)</span> \"When you are lying in bed and when you are sitting.\" Qatadah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِي يَرَاكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who sees you)</span> \"When you are standing, when you are sitting, and in all other situations.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِي السَّاجِدِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And your movements among those who fall prostrate.)</span> Qatadah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِي يَرَاكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ - وَتَقَلُّبَكَ فِي السَّاجِدِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who sees you when you stand up.
