After Allah allowed the Prophet ﷺ to migrate away from them, He sent His torment upon them on the day of Badr. During that battle, the chief pagans were killed, or captured. Allah also directed them to seek forgiveness for the sins, Shirk and wickedness they indulged in. If it was not for the fact that there were some weak Muslims living among the Makkan pagans, those Muslims who invoked Allah for His forgiveness, Allah would have sent down to them the torment that could never be averted. Allah did not do that on account of the weak, ill-treated, and oppressed believers living among them, as He reiterated about the day at Al-Hudaybiyyah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَصَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَالْهَدْيَ مَعْكُوفًا أَن يَبْلُغَ مَحِلَّهُ ۚ وَلَوْلَا رِجَالٌ مُّؤْمِنُونَ وَنِسَاءٌ مُّؤْمِنَاتٌ لَّمْ تَعْلَمُوهُمْ أَن تَطَئُوهُمْ فَتُصِيبَكُم مِّنْهُم مَّعَرَّةٌ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۖ لِّيُدْخِلَ اللَّهُ فِي رَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَاءُ ۚ لَوْ تَزَيَّلُوا لَعَذَّبْنَا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They are the ones who disbelieved and hindered you from Al-Masjid Al-Haram <span class=\"gray\">(at Makkah)</span> and detained the sacrificial animals from reaching their place of sacrifice.

Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا كَانُوا أَوْلِيَاءَهُ ۚ إِنْ أَوْلِيَاؤُهُ إِلَّا الْمُتَّقُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they are not its guardians? None can be its guardians except those who have Taqwa,)</span> meaning, the Prophet ﷺ and his Companions are the true dwellers <span class=\"gray\">(or worthy maintainers)</span> of Al-Masjid Al-Haram, not the pagans. Allah said in other Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا كَانَ لِلْمُشْرِكِينَ أَن يَعْمُرُوا مَسَاجِدَ اللَّهِ شَاهِدِينَ عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِم بِالْكُفْرِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ وَفِي النَّارِ هُمْ خَالِدُونَ - إِنَّمَا يَعْمُرُ مَسَاجِدَ اللَّهِ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَأَقَامَ الصَّلَاةَ وَآتَى الزَّكَاةَ وَلَمْ يَخْشَ إِلَّا اللَّهَ ۖ فَعَسَىٰ أُولَٰئِكَ أَن يَكُونُوا مِنَ الْمُهْتَدِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is not for the polytheists, to maintain the Masjids of Allah, while they witness disbelief against themselves.

It is they who are on true guidance.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[9:17-18]</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَصَدٌّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَكُفْرٌ بِهِ وَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَإِخْرَاجُ أَهْلِهِ مِنْهُ أَكْبَرُ عِندَ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But a greater <span class=\"gray\">(transgression)</span> with Allah is to prevent mankind from following the way of Allah, to disbelieve in Him, to prevent access to Al-Masjid Al-Haram <span class=\"gray\">(at Makkah)</span>, and to drive out its inhabitants,)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:217]</span>.</p><p lang=\"mt\" class=\"mt \">Urwah, As-Suddi and Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنْ أَوْلِيَاؤُهُ إِلَّا الْمُتَّقُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(None can be its guardians except those who have Taqwa,)</span> refers to Muhammad ﷺ and his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all.

Mujahid added that the pagans used to place their fingers in their mouth <span class=\"gray\">(while whistling)</span>. Sa'id bin Jubayr said that Ibn 'Abbas commented on Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا كَانَ صَلَاتُهُمْ عِندَ الْبَيْتِ إِلَّا مُكَاءً وَتَصْدِيَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Their Salat at the House was nothing but Muka' and Tasdiyah.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"The Quraysh used to perform Tawaf <span class=\"gray\">(encircling the Ka'bah)</span> while naked, whistling and clapping their hands, for Muka' means 'whistling', while, Tasdiyah means 'clapping the hands.'\" This meaning was also reported from Ibn 'Abbas, by 'Ali bin Abi Talhah and Al-'Awfi. Similar was recorded from Ibn 'Umar, Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka'b, Abu Salamah bin 'Abdur-Rahman, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah, 'Atiyyah Al-'Awfi, Hujr bin 'Anbas and Ibn Abza.

This is when 'Abdullah bin Abi Rabi'ah, 'Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl, Safwan bin Umayyah and other men from Quraysh who lost their fathers, sons or brothers in Badr, went to Abu Sufyan bin Harb. They said to him, and to those among the Quraysh who had wealth in that caravan, 'O people of Quraysh! Muhammad has grieved you and killed the chiefs among you. Therefore, help us with this wealth so that we can fight him, it may be that we will avenge our losses.' They agreed.\" Muhammad bin Ishaq said, \"This Ayah was revealed about them, according to Ibn 'Abbas,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَالَهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, those who disbelieve spend their wealth...)</span> until,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(they who are the losers.)</span>\" Mujahid, Sa'id bin Jubayr, Al-Hakam bin 'Uyaynah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ibn Abza said that this Ayah was revealed about Abu Sufyan and his spending money in Uhud to fight the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ad-Dahhak said that this Ayah was revealed about the idolators of Badr. In any case, the Ayah is general, even though there was a specific incident that accompanied its revelation. Allah states here that the disbelievers spend their wealth to hinder from the path of truth. However, by doing that, their money will be spent and then will become a source of grief and anguish for them, availing them nothing in the least. They seek to extinguish the Light of Allah and make their word higher than the word of truth. However, Allah will complete His Light, even though the disbelievers hate it. He will give aid to His religion, make His Word dominant, and His religion will prevail above all religions. This is the disgrace that the disbelievers will taste in this life; and in the Hereafter, they will taste the torment of the Fire. Whoever among them lives long, will witness with his eyes and hear with his ears what causes grief to him. Those among them who are killed or die will be returned to eternal disgrace and the everlasting punishment. This is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَسَيُنفِقُونَهَا ثُمَّ تَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ حَسْرَةً ثُمَّ يُغْلَبُونَ ۗ وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا إِلَىٰ جَهَنَّمَ يُحْشَرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And so will they continue to spend it; but in the end it will become an anguish for them. Then they will be overcome. And those who disbelieve will be gathered unto Hell.)</span></p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لِيَمِيزَ اللَّهُ الْخَبِيثَ مِنَ الطَّيِّبِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In order that Allah may distinguish the wicked from the good.)</span>, meaning recognize the difference between the people of happiness and the people of misery, according to Ibn 'Abbas, as 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from him. Allah distinguishes between those believers who obey Him and fight His disbelieving enemies and those who disobey Him. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَّا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيَذَرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ عَلَىٰ مَا أَنتُمْ عَلَيْهِ حَتَّىٰ يَمِيزَ الْخَبِيثَ مِنَ الطَّيِّبِ ۗ وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُطْلِعَكُمْ عَلَى الْغَيْبِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He distinguishes the wicked from the good.
