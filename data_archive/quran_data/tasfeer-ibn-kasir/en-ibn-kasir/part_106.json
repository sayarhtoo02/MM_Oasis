Whoever denies even one Messenger, then he has disbelieved in all of the Messengers, thus they are described as rejecting \"the Messengers\". Allah tells us that he <span class=\"gray\">(Salih)</span> brought them signs to prove that what he was telling them was true, such as the she-camel which Allah created for them out of a solid rock in response to the supplication of Salih. This she-camel was grazing on their lands, and the people and the camel took water on alternate days that were well-known. When they rebelled and killed it, he said to them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">تَمَتَّعُوا فِي دَارِكُمْ ثَلَاثَةَ أَيَّامٍ ۖ ذَٰلِكَ وَعْدٌ غَيْرُ مَكْذُوبٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(\"Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days. This is a promise which will not be belied.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[11:65]</span> Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ فَاسْتَحَبُّوا الْعَمَىٰ عَلَى الْهُدَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And as for Thamud, We showed them and made the path of truth clear but they preferred blindness to guidance.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[41:17]</span> Allah tells us that,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَانُوا يَنْحِتُونَ مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا آمِنِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they used to hew out dwellings from the mountains, <span class=\"gray\">(feeling)</span> secure.)</span> meaning, they were without fear and they had no real need for those houses; it was merely a form of extravagance and work without a purpose. This could be seen from their work in the houses in the Al-Hijr through which the Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed on his way to Tabuk. He covered his head and urged his camel to go faster, saying to his Companions:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا تَدْخُلُوا بُيُوتَ الْقَوْمِ الْمُعَذَّبِينَ إِلَّا أَنْ تَكُونُوا بَاكِينَ، فَإِنَّ لَمْ تَبْكُوا فَتَبَاكُوا خَشْيَةَ أَنْ يُصِيبَكُمْ مَا أَصَابَهُم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do not enter the dwellings of those who were punished unless you are weeping, and if you do not weep then make yourself weep out of fear that perhaps what struck them may also strike you.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَةُ مُصْبِحِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But the Sayhah <span class=\"gray\">(torment - awful cry)</span> overtook them in the early morning.)</span> meaning in the morning of the fourth day.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَمَا أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And all that they used to earn availed them not.)</span> meaning all of the benefits that they used to gain from their crops and fruits, and the water which they did not want to share with the she-camel that they killed so that it would not reduce their share of the water - all of that wealth would not protect them or help them when the command of their Lord came to pass.</p>"

Then Allah informed His Prophet ﷺ about the Hour, and that it will be the faults of the idolators when they insult him and reject the Message that he brings to them. This is like the Ayah,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">فَاصْفَحْ عَنْهُمْ وَقُلْ سَلَامٌ ۚ فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So turn away from them, and say: \"Salam <span class=\"gray\">(Peace!)</span>.\" But they will come to know)</span><span class=\"gray\">(43:89)</span>. Mujahid, Qatadah and others said: \"This was before fighting was prescribed\". It is as they said, because this Surah was revealed in Makkah and fighting was prescribed after the Hijrah.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ الْخَلَّاقُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, your Lord is the Knowing Creator)</span><span class=\"gray\">(15:86)</span>. This is a confirmation of the Day of Resurrection and that Allah, may He be exalted, is able to bring the Hour to pass. He is the Creator and nothing is beyond Him. He is the Knowing, Who knows what has been dispersed from people's bodies and scattered throughout the regions of the earth, as He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَوَلَيْسَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَىٰ أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُم ۚ بَلَىٰ وَهُوَ الْخَلَّاقُ الْعَلِيمُ - إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُ إِذَا أَرَادَ شَيْئًا أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ - فَسُبْحَانَ الَّذِي بِيَدِهِ مَلَكُوتُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Is not He, Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them Yes, indeed! He is the Knowing, Creator. Verily, His command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, \"Be!\" - and it is! So glorified and exalted is He above all that they associate with Him, and in whose Hands is the dominion of all things, and to Him you shall return.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(36:81-83)</span>.</p>"
