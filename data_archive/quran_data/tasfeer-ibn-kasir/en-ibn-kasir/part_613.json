And whoever is moved away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful. The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception <span>(185)</span>You shall certainly be tried and tested in your wealth and properties and in yourselves, and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you <span class=\"gray\">(Jews and Christians)</span> and from those who ascribe partners to Allah; but if you persevere patiently, and have Taqwa, then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs <span>(186)</span></p><div lang=\"ga\" class=\"ga \"><h2>Every Soul Shall Taste Death</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah issues a general and encompassing statement that every living soul shall taste death. In another statement, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ - وَيَبْقَىٰ وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whatsoever is on it <span class=\"gray\">(the earth)</span> will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of majesty and honor will remain forever)</span><span class=\"gray\">[55:26-27]</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, Allah Alone is the Ever-Living Who never dies, while the Jinn, mankind and angels, including those who carry Allah's Throne, shall die. The Irresistible One and Only, will alone remain for ever and ever, remaining Last, as He was the First. This Ayah comforts all creation, since every soul that exists on the earth shall die. When the term of this life comes to an end and the sons of Adam no longer have any new generations, and thus this world ends, Allah will command that the Day of Resurrection commence. Allah will then recompense the creation for their deeds, whether minor or major, many or few, big or small. Surely, Allah will not deal unjustly with anyone, even the weight of an atom, and this is why He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّمَا تُوَفَّوْنَ أُجُورَكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(185. And only on the Day of Resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Who Shall Gain Ultimate Victory?</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> فَمَن زُحْزِحَ عَنِ النَّارِ وَأُدْخِلَ الْجَنَّةَ فَقَدْ فَازَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whoever is moved away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful.)</span> meaning, whoever is kept away from the Fire, saved from it and entered into Paradise, will have achieved the ultimate success.</p><p lang=\"jv\" class=\"jv \">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَوْضِعُ سَوْطٍ فِي الْجَنَّةِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا، اقْرَأُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(A place in Paradise as small as that which is occupied by a whip is better than the world and whatever is on its surface. Read if you will)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> فَمَن زُحْزِحَ عَنِ النَّارِ وَأُدْخِلَ الْجَنَّةَ فَقَدْ فَازَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful)</span>. This was collected in the Two Sahihs, but using another chain of narration and without the addition <span class=\"gray\">(the Ayah.)</span> Abu Hatim Ibn Hibban recorded it in his Sahih without the addition as did Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا مَتَاعُ الْغُرُورِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception.)</span> belittling the value of this life and degrading its importance. This life is short, little and finite, just as Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَلْ تُؤْثِرُونَ الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا - وَالْآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Nay, you prefer the life of this world. Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[87:16-17]</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا أُوتِيتُم مِّن شَيْءٍ فَمَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَزِينَتُهَا وَمَا عِندَ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whatever you have been given is an enjoyment of the life of <span class=\"gray\">(this)</span> world and its adornment, and that <span class=\"gray\">(Hereafter)</span> which is with Allah is better and will remain forever)</span><span class=\"gray\">[28:60]</span>. A Hadith states,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللهِ مَا الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا كَمَا يَغْمِسُ أَحَدُكُمْ أُصْبُعَهُ فِي الْيَمِّ، فَلْيَنْظُرْ بِمَ تَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By Allah! This life, compared to the Hereafter, is just as insignificant as when one of you dips his finger in the sea; let him contemplate what his finger will come back with.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Qatadah commented on Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا مَتَاعُ الْغُرُورِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception.)</span> \"Life is a delight. By Allah, other than Whom there is no deity, it will soon fade away from its people. Therefore, take obedience to Allah from this delight, if you can. Verily, there is no power except from Allah.\"</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Believer is Tested and Hears Grieving Statements from the Enemy</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَتُبْلَوُنَّ فِي أَمْوَالِكُمْ وَأَنفُسِكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(You shall certainly be tried and tested in your wealth and properties and in yourselves)</span>, just as He said in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُم بِشَيْءٍ مِّنَ الْخَوْفِ وَالْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَنفُسِ وَالثَّمَرَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:155]</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, the believer shall be tested, in his wealth, himself, his offspring and family. The believer shall be tested according to the degree of his faith, and when his faith is stronger, the test is larger.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَتَسْمَعُنَّ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَمِنَ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا أَذًى كَثِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you <span class=\"gray\">(Jews and Christians)</span> and from those who ascribe partners to Allah)</span><span class=\"gray\">[3:186]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah said to the believers upon their arrival at Al-Madinah, before Badr, while comforting them against the harm they suffered from the People of the Scriptures and the polytheists;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِن تَصْبِرُوا وَتَتَّقُوا فَإِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عَزْمِ الْأُمُورِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but if you persevere patiently, and have Taqwa, then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, Allah commanded the believers to be forgiving, patient and forbearing until He brought His awaited aid.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari recorded that Usamah bin Zayd said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ rode a donkey with a saddle covered by a velvet sheet and let Usamah ride behind him <span class=\"gray\">(on the donkey)</span>. The Prophet ﷺ wanted to visit Sa'd bin 'Ubadah in Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj, and this occurred before the battle of Badr. The Prophet ﷺ passed by a gathering in which 'Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul was sitting, before 'Abdullah bin Ubayy became Muslim. That gathering was made up of various Muslims as well as Mushriks, who worshipped the idols, and some Jews. 'Abdullah bin Rawahah was sitting in that gathering. When the Prophet ﷺ reached 'Abdullah bin Ubayy, the donkey caused some sand to fall on the group. Then, 'Abdullah bin Ubayy covered his nose with his robe and said, 'Do not fill us with sand.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ greeted the gathering with Salam, called them to Allah and recited some of the Qur'an to them. 'Abdullah bin Ubayy said, 'O fellow! No other speech is better than what you said, if it was true! However, do not bother us in our gatherings. Go back to your place and whoever came to you, narrate your stories to him.' 'Abdullah bin Rawahah said, 'Rather, O Messenger of Allah! Attend our gatherings for we like that.' The Muslims, Mushriks and Jews then cursed each other, and they almost fought with each other. The Prophet ﷺ tried to calm them down, until they finally settled. The Prophet ﷺ rode his donkey and went to Sa'd bin 'Ubadah, saying, 'O Sa'd! Have you heard what Abu Hubbab said <span class=\"gray\">(meaning 'Abdullah bin Ubayy)</span>? He said such and such things.' Sa'd said, 'O Messenger of Allah! Forgive and pardon him. By Allah, Who sent down the Book to you, Allah brought us the truth that you came with at a time when the people of this city almost appointed him king. When Allah changed all that with the truth that He gave you, he choked on it, and this is the reason behind the behavior you saw from him.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ forgave him. Indeed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and his Companions used to forgive the Mushriks and the People of the Scriptures, just as Allah commanded them, and they used to tolerate the harm that they suffered. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَتَسْمَعُنَّ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ وَمِنَ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا أَذًى كَثِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you <span class=\"gray\">(Jews and Christians)</span> and from those who ascribe partners to Allah;)</span><span class=\"gray\">[3:186]</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَدَّ كَثِيرٌ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ لَوْ يَرُدُّونَكُم مِّن بَعْدِ إِيمَانِكُمْ كُفَّارًا حَسَدًا مِّنْ عِندِ أَنفُسِهِم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الْحَقُّ فَاعْفُوا وَاصْفَحُوا حَتَّىٰ يَأْتِيَ اللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Many of the People of the Scripture <span class=\"gray\">(Jews and Christians)</span> wish that they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their own selves, even after the truth has become manifest unto them. But forgive and overlook, till Allah brings His command)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:109]</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Prophet ﷺ used to implement the pardon that Allah commanded him until He gave His command <span class=\"gray\">(to fight the disbelievers)</span>. When the Messenger ﷺ fought at Badr, and Allah killed, by his hand, the leaders of the disbelievers from Quraysh, 'Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul and the Mushriks and idol worshippers who were with him said, 'This matter has prevailed,' and they gave their pledge to the Prophet ﷺ and became Muslims.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, every person who stands for truth, enjoins righteousness and forbids evil, will be harmed in some manner. In such cases, there is no cure better than being patient in Allah's cause, trusting in Him and returning to Him.</p>"
