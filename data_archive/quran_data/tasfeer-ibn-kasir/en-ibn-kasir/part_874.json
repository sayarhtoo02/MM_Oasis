And Allah has power <span class=\"gray\">(over all things)</span>, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful <span>(7)</span>Allah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity <span>(8)</span>It is only as regards those who fought against you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out, that Allah forbids you to befriend them. And whosoever will befriend them, then such are the wrongdoers <span>(9)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Perhaps Allah will make a Friendship between You and Those, whom You hold as Enemies</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah said to His faithful servants, after ordering them to be enemies with the disbelievers,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَسَى اللَّهُ أَنْ يَجْعَلَ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَ الَّذِينَ عَادَيْتُمْ مِنْهُمْ مَوَدَّةً ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Perhaps Allah will make friendship between you and those, whom you hold as enemies.)</span> meaning affection after animosity, tenderness after coldness and coming together after parting from each other,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">وَاللَّهُ قَدِيرٌ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah has power <span class=\"gray\">(over all things)</span>,)</span> Allah is able to gather opposites and bring together hearts, after feeling hostility and hardness. In this case, the hearts will come together in agreement, just as Allah said when He mentioned His favor on the Ansar,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنْتُمْ أَعْدَاءً فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُمْ بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَانًا وَكُنْتُمْ عَلَىٰ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ مِنَ النَّارِ فَأَنْقَذَكُمْ مِنْهَا ۗ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And remember Allah's favor on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His grace, you became brethren and were on the brink of a pit of Fire, and He saved you from it.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(3:103)</span> Also the Prophet ﷺ said to them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَمْ أَجِدْكُمْ ضُلَّالًا فَهَدَاكُمُ اللهُ بِي، وَكُنْتُمْ مُتَفَرِّقِينَ فَأَلَّفَكُمُ اللهُ بِي؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Did I not find you misguided, and Allah guided you through me; and divided, and Allah united <span class=\"gray\">[your hearts]</span> through me?)</span> Allah the Exalted said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنْ يُرِيدُوا أَنْ يَخْدَعُوكَ فَإِنَّ حَسْبَكَ اللَّهُ ۚ هُوَ الَّذِي أَيَّدَكَ بِنَصْرِهِ وَبِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ - وَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِهِمْ ۚ لَوْ أَنْفَقْتَ مَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا مَا أَلَّفْتَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ أَلَّفَ بَيْنَهُمْ ۚ إِنَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He it is Who has supported you with His help and with the believers. And He has united their hearts. If you had spent all that is in the earth, you could not have united their hearts, but Allah has united them. Certainly He is Almighty, All-Wise.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(8:62,63)</span> And in the Hadith:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَحْبِبْ حَبِيبَكَ هَوْنًا مَا، فَعَسَى أَنْ يَكُونَ بَغِيضَكَ يَوْمًا مَا، وَأَبْغِضْ بَغِيضَكَ هَوْنًا مَا، فَعَسَى أَنْ يَكُونَ حَبِيبَكَ يَوْمًا مَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Love your loved one moderately, because one day, he might become your enemy. Hate your hated one moderately, because one day, he might become your loved one.)</span> Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)</span> means, Allah forgives the disbelief of the disbelievers if they repent from it, returned to their Lord and surrendered to Him in Islam. Surely, He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful to those who repent to Him from their sins, no matter what type of the sin it is.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Permissibility of being Kind to Disbelievers who do not fight against the Religion </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And Allah's statement;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا يَنْهَاكُمُ اللَّهُ عَنِ الَّذِينَ لَمْ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ وَلَمْ يُخْرِجُوكُمْ مِنْ دِيَارِكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah does not forbid you with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes,)</span> means, those who did not have a role in your expulsion. Therefore, Allah does not forbid you from being kind to the disbelievers who do not fight you because of the religion, such as women and weak disbelievers,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">أَنْ تَبَرُّوهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(to deal kindly)</span> to be gentle with them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتُقْسِطُوا إِلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and justly with those)</span> to be fair with them</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity.)</span> Imam Ahmad recorded that Asma' bint Abu Bakr said, \"My mother, who was an idolatress at the time, came to me during the Treaty of Peace, the Prophet ﷺ conducted with the Quraysh. I came to the Prophet ﷺ and said, 'O Allah's Messenger! My mother came visiting, desiring something from me, should I treat her with good relations?' The Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نَعَمْ صِلِي أُمَّكِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yes. Keep good relation with your mother.)</span>\" The Two Sahihs recorded this Hadith. Imam Ahmad recorded that 'Abdullah bin Zubayr said, \"Qutaylah came visiting her daughter, Asma' bint Abi Bakr, with some gifts, such as Dibab, cheese and clarified <span class=\"gray\">(cooking)</span> butter, and she was an idolatress at that time. Asma' refused to accept her mother's gifts and did not let her enter her house. 'A'ishah asked the Prophet ﷺ about his verdict and Allah sent down the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا يَنْهَاكُمُ اللَّهُ عَنِ الَّذِينَ لَمْ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah does not forbid you with those who fought not against you on account of religion)</span> until the end of the Ayah. Allah's Messenger ﷺ ordered Asma' to accept her mother's gifts and to let her enter her house.\" Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah loves those who deal with equity.)</span> was duly explained in the Tafsir of Surat Al-Hujurat. We also mentioned the authentic Hadith,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْمُقْسِطُونَ عَلىٰ مَنَابِرَ مِنْ نُورٍ عَنْ يَمِينِ الْعَرْشِ، الَّذِينَ يَعْدِلُونَ فِي حُكْمِهِمْ وَأَهَالِيهِمْ وَمَا وَلُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The just, who are fair in their decisions, families and those under their authority, will be on podiums made of light, to the right of the Throne.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Prohibition of being Kind towards Combatant Disbelievers</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّمَا يَنْهَاكُمُ اللَّهُ عَنِ الَّذِينَ قَاتَلُوكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ وَأَخْرَجُوكُمْ مِنْ دِيَارِكُمْ وَظَاهَرُوا عَلَىٰ إِخْرَاجِكُمْ أَنْ تَوَلَّوْهُمْ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is only as regards those who fought against you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out that Allah forbids you to befriend them.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(60:9)</span> means, 'Allah forbids you from being kind and befriending with the disbelievers who are openly hostile to you, those who fought against you, expelled you and helped to expel you. Allah the Exalted forbids you from being their friends and orders you to be their enemy.' </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah stresses His threat against being friends with them, by saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ يَتَوَلَّهُمْ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whosoever will befriend them, then such are the wrongdoers.)</span> As He said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّخِذُوا الْيَهُودَ وَالنَّصَارَىٰ أَوْلِيَاءَ ۘ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءُ بَعْضٍ ۚ وَمَنْ يَتَوَلَّهُمْ مِنْكُمْ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْهُمْ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as protecting friends, they are but protecting friends of each other. And if any among you takes them <span class=\"gray\">(as protecting friends)</span>, then surely, he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the wrongdoers)</span><span class=\"gray\">(5:51)</span></p>"
