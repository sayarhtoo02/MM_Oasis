And they did not wrong Us but they wronged themselves <span>(57)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Shade, the Manna and the Quail</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">After Allah mentioned the calamities that He saved the Children of Israel from, He mentioned the favors that He granted them, saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْغَمَامَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And We shaded you with clouds. This Ayah mentions the white clouds that provided shade for the Children of Israel, protecting them from the sun's heat during their years of wandering. In the Hadith about the trials, An-Nasai recorded Ibn Abbas saying, Allah shaded the Children of Israel with clouds during the years of wandering. Ibn Abi Hatim said, Narrations similar to that of Ibn Abbas were reported from Ibn Umar, Ar-Rabi' bin Anas, Abu Mijlaz, Ad-Dahhak, and As-Suddi. Al-Hasan and Qatadah said that,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْغَمَامَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We shaded you with clouds)</span> \"This happened when they were in the desert and the clouds shielded them from the sun.\" Ibn Jarir said that several scholars said that the type of cloud the Ayah mentioned, \"was cooler and better than the type we know.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas commented on Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَنَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">And sent down on you Al-Manna, The manna used to descend to them to the trees, and they used to eat whatever they wished of it. Also, Qata0dah said, The manna, which was whiter than milk and sweeter than honey, used to rain down on the Children of Israel, just as the snow falls, from dawn until sunrise. One of them would collect enough for that particular day, for if it remained more than that, it would spoil. On the sixth day, Friday, one would collect enough for the sixth and the seventh day, which was the Sabbath during which one would not leave home to seek his livelihood, or for anything else. All this occurred in the wilderness. The type of manna that we know provides sufficient food when eaten alone, because it is nutritious and sweet. When manna is mixed with water, it becomes a sweet drink. It also changes composition when mixed with other types of food. However, this is not the only type. The evidence to this fact is that Al-Bukha0ri narrated, that Sa 0d bin Zayd said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْكَمْأَةُ مِنَ الْمَنِّ وَمَاؤُهَا شِفَاءٌ لِلْعَيْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Kam'ah <span class=\"gray\">(truffles)</span> is a type of manna, and its liquid is a remedy for the eyes.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Hadith was also collected by Imam Ahmad. The group of Hadith compilers, with the exception of Abu Dawud, also collected it, and At-Tirmidhi graded it Hasan Sahih. At-Tirmidhi recorded Abu Hurayrah saying that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْعَجْوَةُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَفِيهَا شِفَاءٌ مِنَ السُّمِّ وَالْكَمْأَةُ مِنَ الْمَنِّ وَمَاؤُهَا شِفَاءٌ لِلْعَيْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The 'Ajwah <span class=\"gray\">(pressed, dried date)</span> is from Paradise and it cures poison, Al-Kam'ah <span class=\"gray\">(truffles)</span> is a form of manna, and its liquid heals the eye.\")</span> At-Tirmidhi is the only one of them who recorded this Hadith.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">As for the quail <span class=\"gray\">(Salwa)</span> in question, 'Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"The <span class=\"gray\">(Salwa)</span> is a bird that looks like the quail.\" This is the same opinion reported from Mujahid, Ash-Sha'bi, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, 'Ikrimah and Ar-Rabi' bin Anas, may Allah have mercy upon them. Also, 'Ikrimah said that the Salwa is a bird in Paradise about the size of a sparrow. Qatadah said \"The Salwa is a bird that is similar to a sparrow. During that time, an Israelite could catch as many quails as was sufficient for that particular day, otherwise the meat would spoil. On the sixth day, Friday, he would collect what is enough for the sixth and the seventh day, the Sabbath, during which one was not allowed to depart his home to seek anything.\"</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُوا مِن طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Eat of the good lawful things We have provided for you,)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7:160)</span> this form of command is a simple order of allowance, guiding to what is good. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they did not wrong Us but they wronged themselves)</span> means, 'We commanded them to eat from what We gave them, and to perform the acts of worship <span class=\"gray\">(but they rebelled)</span>.' This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُوا مِن رِّزْقِ رَبِّكُمْ وَاشْكُرُوا لَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Eat of the provision of your Lord, and be grateful to Him)</span><span class=\"gray\">(34:15)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Yet, the Children of Israel rebelled, disbelieved and committed injustice against themselves, even though they saw the clear signs, tremendous miracles and extraordinary events.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Virtue of Muhammad's Companions over the Companions of all Other Prophets</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Here it is important to point out the virtue of Muhammad's Companions over the companions of the other Prophets. This includes firmness in the religion, patience and the lack of arrogance, may Allah be pleased with them. Although the Companions accompanied the Prophet ﷺ in his travels and battles, such as during the battle of Tabuk, in intense heat and hardship, they did not ask for a miracle, though this was easy for the Prophet ﷺ by Allah's leave. And when the Companions became hungry, they merely asked the Prophet ﷺ - to invoke Allah - for an increase in the amount of food. They collected whatever food they had and brought it to the Prophet ﷺ, and he asked Allah to bless it, told each of them to take some food, and they filled every pot they had. Also, when they needed rain, the Prophet ﷺ asked Allah to send down rain, and a rain cloud came. They drank, gave water to their camels and filled their water skins. When they looked around, they found that the cloud had only rained on their camp. This is the best example of those who were willing to accept Allah's decision and follow the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.</p>"
