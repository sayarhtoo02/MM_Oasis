And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful <span>(96)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Mujahid and those Who Do not Join Jihad are Not the Same <span class=\"so gray\" lang=\"so\">[and Jihad is Fard Kifayah]</span></h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari recorded that Al-Bara' said, \"When the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّا يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Not equal are those of the believers who sit <span class=\"gray\">(at home)</span>,)</span> was revealed, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ called Zayd and commanded him to write it. Then, Ibn Umm Maktum came and mentioned that he was blind. Allah revealed,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">غَيْرُ أُولِي الضَّرَرِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(except those who are disabled <span class=\"gray\">(by injury or are blind or lame)</span>)</span>.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari recorded that Sahl bin Sa'd As-Sa'di said, \"I saw Marwan bin Al-Hakam sitting in the Masjid. I came and sat by his side. He told us that Zayd bin Thabit told him that Allah's Messenger ﷺ dictated this Ayah to him,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّا يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُولِي الضَّرَرِ وَالْمُجَاهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Not equal are those of the believers who sit <span class=\"gray\">(at home)</span>, except those who are disabled, and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Umm Maktum came to the Prophet ﷺ as he was dictating that very Ayah to me. Ibn Umm Maktum said, 'O Allah's Messenger! By Allah, if I had power, I would surely take part in Jihad.' He was a blind man. So Allah sent down revelation to His Messenger while his thigh was on mine and it became so heavy for me that I feared that my thigh would be broken. That ended after Allah revealed,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">غَيْرُ أُولِي الضَّرَرِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(except those who are disabled)</span>.\" This was recorded by Al-Bukhari. At-Tirmidhi recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّا يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُولِي الضَّرَرِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Not equal are those of the believers who sit <span class=\"gray\">(at home)</span>, except those who are disabled)</span>, refers to those who did not go to the battle of Badr and those who went to Badr. When the battle of Badr was about to occur, Abu Ahmad bin Jahsh and Ibn Umm Maktum said, 'We are blind, O Messenger of Allah! Do we have an excuse?' The Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّا يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُولِي الضَّرَرِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Not equal are those of the believers who sit <span class=\"gray\">(at home)</span>, except those who are disabled)</span> was revealed.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah made those who fight, above those who sit in their homes not hindered by disability.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَفَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَاهِدِينَ عَلَى الْقَاعِدِينَ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا - دَرَجَاتٍ مِّنْهُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit <span class=\"gray\">(at home)</span>, by a huge reward. Degrees of <span class=\"gray\">(higher)</span> grades from Him)</span>, above the believers who sit at home without a disability hindering them.\" This is the wording recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who said, \"Hasan Gharib. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّا يَسْتَوِي الْقَاعِدُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Not equal are those of the believers who sit <span class=\"gray\">(at home)</span>,)</span> this is general. Soon after, the revelation came down with,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">غَيْرُ أُولِي الضَّرَرِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(except those who are disabled)</span>. So whoever has a disability, such as blindness, a limp, or an illness that prevents them from joining Jihad, they were not compared to the Mujahidin who strive in Allah's cause with their selves and wealth, as those who are not disabled and did not join the Jihad were.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In his Sahih, Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ بِالْمَدِينَةِ أَقْوَامًا مَا سِرْتُمْ مِنْ مَسِيرٍ، وَلَا قَطَعْتُمْ مِنْ وَادٍ، إِلَّا وَهُمْ مَعَكُمْ فِيهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There are people who remained in Al-Madinah, who were with you in every march you marched and every valley you crossed.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قالوا: وهم بالمدينة يا رسول الله؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">They said, \"While they are still in Al-Madinah, O Messenger of Allah?\" He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">نَعَمْ حَبَسَهُمُ الْعُذْرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Yes. Only their disability hindered them <span class=\"gray\">(from joining you)</span>.)</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكُلًّا وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْحُسْنَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Unto each, Allah has promised good)</span> meaning, Paradise and tremendous rewards. This Ayah indicates that Jihad is not Fard on each and every individual, but it is Fard Kifayah <span class=\"gray\">(which is a collective duty)</span>. Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَفَضَّلَ اللَّهُ الْمُجَاهِدِينَ عَلَى الْقَاعِدِينَ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit <span class=\"gray\">(at home)</span>, by a huge reward)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah mentions what He has given them rooms in Paradise, along with His forgiveness and the descent of mercy and blessing on them, as a favor and honor from Him. So He said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">دَرَجَاتٍ مِّنْهُ وَمَغْفِرَةً وَرَحْمَةً وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Degrees of <span class=\"gray\">(higher)</span> grades from Him, and forgiveness and mercy. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)</span>. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ مِائَةَ دَرَجَةٍ، أَعَدَّهَا اللهُ لِلْمُجَاهِدِينَ فِي سَبِيلِهِ، مَا بَيْنَ كُلِّ دَرَجَتَيْنِ كَمَا بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There are a hundred grades in Paradise that Allah has prepared for the Mujahidin in His cause, between each two grades is the distance between heaven and Earth.)</span></p>"
