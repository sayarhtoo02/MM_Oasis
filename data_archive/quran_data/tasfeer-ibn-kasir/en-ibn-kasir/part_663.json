He said, 'There is nothing wrong with that,' and recited:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَقْبَلُ التَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants)</span>.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَيَعْفُو عَنِ السَّيِّئَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and forgives sins,)</span> means, He will accept repentance in the future, and He forgives past sins.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَفْعَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and He knows what you do.)</span> means, He knows all your deeds and actions and words, yet He still accepts the repentance of those who repent to Him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَسْتَجِيبُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He answers those who believe and do righteous good deeds,)</span> As-Suddi said, \"This means, He responds to them.\" This was also the view of Ibn Jarir: \"It means that He answers their supplication for themselves, their companions and their brothers.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَزِيدُهُمْ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and gives them increase of His bounty.)</span> means, He answers their supplications and gives them more besides. Qatadah said, narrating from Ibrahim An-Nakha'i Al-Lakhmi about the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَسْتَجِيبُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He answers those who believe and do righteous good deeds,)</span> – <span class=\"gray\">(this means)</span> they intercede for their brothers;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَيَزِيدُهُمْ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and gives them increase of His bounty.)</span> – <span class=\"gray\">(this means)</span> they intercede for their brothers' brothers.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْكَافِرُونَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And as for the disbelievers, theirs will be a severe torment.)</span> – having mentioned the believers and the great reward that is theirs, Allah then mentions the disbelievers and the severe, painful, agonizing torment that they will find with Him on the Day of Resurrection, the Day when they are brought to account.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Reason why Provision is not Increased</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ بَسَطَ اللَّهُ الرِّزْقَ لِعِبَادِهِ لَبَغَوْا فِي الْأَرْضِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if Allah were to extend the provision for His servants, they would surely rebel in the earth,)</span> means, 'if We gave them more provision than they need, this would make them rebel and transgress against one another in an arrogant and insolent manner.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَلَٰكِنْ يُنَزِّلُ بِقَدَرٍ مَا يَشَاءُ ۚ إِنَّهُ بِعِبَادِهِ خَبِيرٌ بَصِيرٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but He sends down by measure as He wills. Verily, He is, in respect of His servants, the Well-Aware, the All-Seer.)</span> means, but He gives them provision according to what is in their best interests, and He knows best about that. So He makes rich those who deserve to be rich, and He makes poor those who deserve to be poor.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ الَّذِي يُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا قَنَطُوا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired,)</span> means, after the people have given up hope that rain will fall, He sends it down upon them at their time of need. This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنْ كَانُوا مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يُنَزَّلَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِنْ قَبْلِهِ لَمُبْلِسِينَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, before that <span class=\"gray\">(rain)</span> – just before it was sent down upon them – they were in despair!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(30:49)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَيَنْشُرُ رَحْمَتَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and spreads His mercy.)</span> means, He bestows it upon all the people who live in that region. Qatadah said, \"We were told that a man said to 'Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, 'O Commander of the faithful, no rain has come and the people are in despair.' 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said, 'Rain will be sent upon you,' and he recited:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ الَّذِي يُنَزِّلُ الْغَيْثَ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا قَنَطُوا وَيَنْشُرُ رَحْمَتَهُ ۚ وَهُوَ الْوَلِيُّ الْحَمِيدُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired, and spreads His mercy. And He is the Protector, Worthy of all praise)</span>.\" Meaning He is the One Who is in control of His creation, taking care of what will benefit them in this world and the Hereafter, and the consequences of all His decrees and actions are good, for which He is worthy of all praise.</p>"
