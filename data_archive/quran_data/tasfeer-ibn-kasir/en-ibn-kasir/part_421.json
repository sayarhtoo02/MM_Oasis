Allah said to the disbelievers,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِن كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍ مِّمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَى عَبْدِنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if you <span class=\"gray\">(Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians)</span> are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. the Qur'an)</span> to Our servant)</span> meaning, Muhammad ﷺ,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(then produce a Surah <span class=\"gray\">(chapter)</span>)</span> meaning, similar to what he brought to you. Hence, if you claim that what he was sent with did not come from Allah, then produce something similar to what he has brought to you, using the help of anyone you wish instead of Allah. However, you will not be able to succeed in this quest. Ibn 'Abbas said that,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">شُهَدَآءَكُمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(your witnesses)</span> means \"Aids.\" Also, As-Suddi reported that Abu Malik said the Ayah means, \"Your partners, meaning, some other people to help you in that. Meaning then go and seek the help of your deities to support and aid you.\" Also, Mujahid said that,</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">وَادْعُواْ شُهَدَآءَكُم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and call your witnesses)</span> means, \"People, meaning, wise and eloquent men who will provide the testimony that you seek.\"</p><div lang=\"sr\" class=\"sr \"><h2>The Challenge</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah challenged the disbelievers in various parts of the Qur'an. For instance, Allah said in Surat Al-Qasas <span class=\"gray\">(28:49)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ فَأْتُوا بِكِتَابٍ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ هُوَ أَهْدَىٰ مِنْهُمَا أَتَّبِعْهُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say <span class=\"gray\">(to them, O Muhammad ﷺ)</span>: \"Then bring a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than these two <span class=\"gray\">(the Tawrah <span class=\"gray\">(Torah)</span> and the Qur'an)</span>, that I may follow it, if you are truthful\")</span>. Also, Allah said in Surat Al-Isra' <span class=\"gray\">(17:88)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُل لَّئِنِ اجْتَمَعَتِ الْإِنسُ وَالْجِنُّ عَلَىٰ أَن يَأْتُوا بِمِثْلِ هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنِ لَا يَأْتُونَ بِمِثْلِهِ وَلَوْ كَانَ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ ظَهِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"If mankind and the Jinn were together to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another.\")</span> Allah said in Surat Hud <span class=\"gray\">(11:13)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ ۖ قُلْ فَأْتُوا بِعَشْرِ سُوَرٍ مِّثْلِهِ مُفْتَرَيَاتٍ وَادْعُوا مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتُم مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Or they say, \"He <span class=\"gray\">(Prophet Muhammad ﷺ)</span> forged it <span class=\"gray\">(the Qur'an)</span>.\" Say: \"Bring you then ten forged Surahs <span class=\"gray\">(chapters)</span> like it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah <span class=\"gray\">(to your help)</span>, if you speak the truth!\")</span>, and in Surat Yunus <span class=\"gray\">(10:37-38)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا كَانَ هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنُ أَن يُفْتَرَىٰ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَلَٰكِن تَصْدِيقَ الَّذِي بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ وَتَفْصِيلَ الْكِتَابِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ مِن رَّبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ - أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ ۖ قُلْ فَأْتُوا بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِ وَادْعُوا مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتُم مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And this Qur'an is not such as could ever be produced by other than Allah <span class=\"gray\">(Lord of the heavens and the earth)</span>, but it is a confirmation of <span class=\"gray\">(the revelation)</span> which was before it <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. the Tawrah, and the Injil)</span>, and a full explanation of the Book <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. Laws decreed for mankind)</span> ـ wherein there is no doubt ـ from the Lord of all that exists.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(Or do they say: \"He <span class=\"gray\">(Muhammad )</span> has forged it?\" Say: \"Bring then a Surah <span class=\"gray\">(chapter)</span> like it, and call upon whomsoever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful!\")</span>. All of these Ayat were revealed in Makkah.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah also challenged the disbelievers in the Ayat that were revealed in Al-Madinah. In this Ayah, Allah said,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَإِن كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if you <span class=\"gray\">(Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians)</span> are in Rayb)</span> meaning, doubt.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مِّمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَى عَبْدِنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Concerning that which We have sent down <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. the Qur'an)</span> to Our servant)</span> meaning, Muhammad ,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(then produce a Surah <span class=\"gray\">(chapter)</span> the like thereof)</span> meaning, similar to the Qur'an. This is the Tafsir of Mujahid, Qatadah, Ibn Jarir At-Tabari, Az-Zamakhshari and Ar-Razi. Ar-Razi said that this is the Tafsir of 'Umar, Ibn Mas'ud, Ibn 'Abbas, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and the majority of the scholars. And he gave preference to this view and mentioned the fact that Allah has challenged the disbelievers as individuals and as groups, whether literate or illiterate, thus making the challenge truly complete. This type of challenge is more daring than simply challenging the disbelievers who might not be literate or knowledgeable. This is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">فَأْتُواْ بِعَشْرِ سُوَرٍ مِّثْلِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Bring you then ten forged Surahs <span class=\"gray\">(chapters)</span> like it)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11:13)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لاَ يَأْتُونَ بِمِثْلِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They could not produce the like thereof)</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:88)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, this is a general challenge to the Arab disbelievers, the most eloquent among all nations. Allah challenged the Arab disbelievers both in Makkah and Al-Madinah several times, especially since they had tremendous hatred and enmity for the Prophet ﷺ and his religion. Yet, they were unable to succeed in answering the challenge, and this is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَلَن تَفْعَلُواْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But if you do it not, and you can never do it)</span>, indicating that they will never be able to answer the challenge. This is another miracle, in that, Allah clearly stated without doubt that the Qur'an will never be opposed or challenged by anything similar to it, for eternity. This is a true statement that has not been changed until the present and shall never change. How can anyone be able to produce something like the Qur'an, when the Qur'an is the Word of Allah Who created everything? How can the words of the created ever be similar to the Words of the Creator?</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Examples of the Miracle of the Qur'an</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Whoever reads through the Qur'an will realize that it contains various levels of superiority through both the apparent and hidden meanings that it mentions. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الر ۚ كِتَابٌ أُحْكِمَتْ آيَاتُهُ ثُمَّ فُصِّلَتْ مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ خَبِيرٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Alif Lam Ra. <span class=\"gray\">(This is)</span> a Book, the verses whereof are perfect <span class=\"gray\">(in every sphere of knowledge, etc.)</span>, and then explained in detail from One <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span>, Who is Wise and well-acquainted <span class=\"gray\">(with all things)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">(11:1)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So the expressions in the Qur'an are perfect and its meanings are explained. Further, every word and meaning in the Qur'an is eloquent and cannot be surpassed. The Qur'an also mentioned the stories of the people of the past; and these accounts and stories occurred exactly as the Qur'an stated. Also, the Qur'an commanded every type of righteousness and forbade every type of evil, just as Allah stated,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَمَّتْ كَلِمَتُ رَبِّكَ صِدْقًا وَعَدْلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:115)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, true in the stories it narrates and just in its Laws. The Qur'an is true, just and full of guidance. It does not contain exaggerations, lies or falsehood, unlike Arabic and other types of poems that contained lies. These poems, conform with the popular statement, \"The most eloquent speech is the one that contains the most lies!\" Sometimes, one would find a long poem that mainly contains descriptions of women, horses or alcohol. Or, the poem might contain praise or the description of a certain person, horse, camel, war, incident, fear, lion, or other types of items and objects. Such praise or descriptions do not bring any benefit, except shed light on the poet's ability to clearly and eloquently describe such items. Yet, one will only be able to find one or two sentences in many long poems that elaborate on the main theme of the poem, while the rest of the poem contains insignificant descriptions and repetitions.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">As for the Qur'an, it is entirely eloquent in the most perfect manner, as those who have knowledge in such matters and understand Arabic methods of speech and expressions concur. When one reads through the stories in the Qur'an, he will find them fruitful, whether they were in extended or short forms, repeated or not. The more these stories are repeated, the more fruitful and beautiful they become. The Qur'an does not become old when one repeats reciting it, nor do the scholars ever get bored with it. When the Qur'an mentions the subject of warning and promises, it presents truths that would make solid, firm mountains shake, so what about the comprehending, understanding hearts? When the Qur'an promises, it opens the hearts and the ears, making them eager to attain the abode of peace - Paradise - and to be the neighbors of the Throne of the Most Beneficent. For instance, on the subject of promises and encouragement, the Qur'an said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّا أُخْفِيَ لَهُم مِّن قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ جَزَاءً بِمَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do)</span><span class=\"gray\">(32:17)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الْأَنفُسُ وَتَلَذُّ الْأَعْيُنُ ۖ وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(There will be)</span> therein all that inner selves could desire, and all that eyes could delight in and you will abide therein forever)</span><span class=\"gray\">(43:71)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">On the subject of warning and discouragement;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَأَمِنتُمْ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمْ جَانِبَ الْبَرِّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do you then feel secure that He will not cause a side of the land to swallow you up)</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:68)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَأَمِنتُم مَّن فِي السَّمَاءِ أَن يَخْسِفَ بِكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فَإِذَا هِيَ تَمُورُ - أَمْ أَمِنتُم مَّن فِي السَّمَاءِ أَن يُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ حَاصِبًا ۖ فَسَتَعْلَمُونَ كَيْفَ نَذِيرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span>, will not cause the earth to sink with you, and then it should quake? Or do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span>, will not send against you a violent whirlwind? Then you shall know how <span class=\"gray\">(terrible)</span> has been My warning)</span><span class=\"gray\">(67:16-17)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">On the subject of threats, the Qur'an said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَكُلًّا أَخَذْنَا بِذَنبِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So We punished each <span class=\"gray\">(of them)</span> for his sins)</span><span class=\"gray\">(29:40)</span>. Also, on the subject of soft advice, the Qur'an said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَرَأَيْتَ إِن مَّتَّعْنَاهُمْ سِنِينَ - ثُمَّ جَاءَهُم مَّا كَانُوا يُوعَدُونَ - مَا أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا يـُمَتَّعُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Tell Me, <span class=\"gray\">(even)</span> if We do let them enjoy for years. And afterwards comes to them that <span class=\"gray\">(punishment)</span> which they had been promised. All that with which they used to enjoy shall not avail them)</span><span class=\"gray\">(26:205-207)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There are many other examples of the eloquence, beauty, and benefits of the Qur'an.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When the Qur'an is discussing Laws, commandments and prohibitions, it commands every type of righteous, good, pleasing and beneficial act. It also forbids every type of evil, disliked and amoral act. Ibn Mas'ud and other scholars of the Salaf said, \"When you hear what Allah said in the Qur'an, such as,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe!)</span>, then listen with full attention, for it either contains a type of righteousness that Allah is enjoining, or an evil that He is forbidding.\" For instance, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَأْمُرُهُم بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَاهُمْ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ وَيُحِلُّ لَهُمُ الطَّيِّبَاتِ وَيُحَرِّمُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْخَبَائِثَ وَيَضَعُ عَنْهُمْ إِصْرَهُمْ وَالْأَغْلَالَ الَّتِي كَانَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He <span class=\"gray\">(Muhammad ﷺ)</span> commands them for Al-Ma'ruf <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained)</span>; and forbids them from Al-Munkar <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden)</span>; he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibat<span class=\"gray\">(i.e. all good and lawful things)</span>, and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khaba'ith <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. all evil and unlawful things)</span>, he releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters <span class=\"gray\">(bindings)</span> that were upon them)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7:157)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">When the Ayat mention Resurrection and the horrors that will occur on that Day, and Paradise and the Fire and the joys and safe refuge that Allah prepared for His loyal friends, or torment and Hell for His enemies, these Ayat contain glad tidings or warnings. The Ayat then call to perform good deeds and avoid evil deeds, making the life of this world less favorable and the Hereafter more favorable. They also establish the correct methods and guide to Allah's straight path and just legislation, all the while ridding the hearts of the evil of the cursed devil.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Qur'an is the Greatest Miracle given to the Prophet <span class=\"gray\">(ﷺ)</span></h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Two Sahihs record that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا مِنْ نَبِيٍّ مِنَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ إِلَّا قَدْ أُعْطِيَ مِنَ الآيَاتِ مَا آمَنَ عَلَى مِثْلِهِ الْبَشَرُ، وَإنَّمَا كَانَ الَّذِي أُوتِيتُه وَحْيًا أَوْحَاهُ اللهُ إِلَيَّ فَأَرْجُو أَنْ أَكُونَ أَكْثَرَهُمْ تَابِعًا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Every Prophet was given a miracle, the type of which brings mankind to faith. What I was given is a revelation that Allah sent down to me. Yet, I hope that I will have the most following on the Day of Resurrection.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the wording narrated by Muslim. The Prophet ﷺ stated that among the Prophets he was given a revelation, meaning, he was especially entrusted with the miraculous Qur'an that challenged mankind to produce something similar to it. As for the rest of the divinely revealed Books, they were not miraculous according to many scholars. Allah knows best. The Prophet ﷺ was also aided with innumerable signs and indications that testify to the truth of his prophethood and what he was sent with, all thanks and praise is due to Allah.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Meaning of 'Stones'</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَاتَّقُوا النَّارَ الَّتِي وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ ۖ أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَافِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then fear the Fire <span class=\"gray\">(Hell)</span> whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:24)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Fuel' is wood, or similar substances, used to start and feed a fire. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَمَّا الْقَاسِطُونَ فَكَانُوا لِجَهَنَّمَ حَطَبًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And as for the Qasitun <span class=\"gray\">(disbelievers who deviated from the right path)</span>, they shall be firewood for Hell)</span><span class=\"gray\">(72:15)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ أَنتُمْ لَهَا وَارِدُونَ - لَوْ كَانَ هَٰؤُلَاءِ آلِهَةً مَّا وَرَدُوهَا ۖ وَكُلٌّ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Certainly you <span class=\"gray\">(disbelievers)</span> and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah, are <span class=\"gray\">(but)</span> fuel for Hell! <span class=\"gray\">(Surely)</span> you enter it. Had these <span class=\"gray\">(idols)</span> been alihah <span class=\"gray\">(gods)</span>, they would not have entered there <span class=\"gray\">(Hell)</span>, and all of them will abide therein)</span><span class=\"gray\">(21:98-99)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The stones mentioned here are the giant, rotten, black, sulfuric stones that become the hottest when heated, may Allah save us from this evil end. It was also reported that the stones mentioned here are the idols and rivals that were worshipped instead of Allah, just as Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّكُمْ وَمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ حَصَبُ جَهَنَّمَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Certainly you <span class=\"gray\">(disbelievers)</span> and that which you are worshipping now besides Allah,are <span class=\"gray\">(but)</span> fuel for Hell!)</span><span class=\"gray\">(21:98)</span>.</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَافِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(prepared for the disbelievers)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It appears most obvious that it refers to the Fire that is fueled by men and stones, and it also may refer to the stones themselves. There is no contradiction between these two views, because they are dependent upon each other. 'Prepared' means, it is 'kept' and will surely touch those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger ﷺ. Ibn Ishaq narrated that Muhammad said that 'Ikrimah or Sa'id bin Jubayr said that Ibn 'Abbas said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُعِدَّتْ لِلْكَافِرِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(prepared for the disbelievers)</span>,</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"For those who embrace the disbelief that you <span class=\"gray\">(disbelievers)</span> have embraced.\"</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Jahannam <span class=\"ky gray\" lang=\"ky\">(Hellfire)</span> exists now</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Many of the Imams of the Sunnah used this Ayah to prove that the Fire exists now. This is because Allah said,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">أُعِدَّتْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(prepared)</span> meaning, prepared and kept. There are many Hadiths on this subject. For instance, the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">تَحَاجَّتِ الْجَنَّةُ وَالنَّارُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Paradise and the Fire had an argument..)</span></p><p lang=\"nl\" class=\"nl \">Also, the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اسْتَأْذَنَتِ النَّارُ رَبَّهَا فَقَالَتْ: رَبِّ أَكَلَ بَعضِي بَعْضًا فَأذِنَ لَهَا بِنَفَسَيْنِ: نَفَسٍ فِي الشِّتَاءِ وَنَفَسٍ فِي الصَّيْفِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Fire sought the permission of her Lord. She said, 'O my Lord! Some parts of me consumed the other parts.' And Allah allowed her two periods to exhale, one in winter and one in summer.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Also, there is a Hadith recorded from Ibn Mas'ud that the Companions heard the sound of a falling object. When they asked about it, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَذَا حَجَرٌ أُلْقِيَ بِهِ مِنْ شَفِيرِ جَهَنَّمَ مُنْذُ سَبْعِينَ سَنَةً، الْآنَ وَصَلَ إِلى قَعْرِهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(This is a stone that was thrown from the top of Jahannam seventy years ago, but only now reached its bottom.)</span> This Hadith is in Sahih Muslim.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There are many Hadiths that are Mutawatir <span class=\"gray\">(narrated by many different chains of narrations)</span> on this subject, such as the Hadiths about the eclipse prayer, the night of Isra' etc.</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statements,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأْتُواْ بِسُورَةٍ مِّن مِّثْلِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then produce a Surah <span class=\"gray\">(chapter)</span> of the like thereof)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:23)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(A Surah <span class=\"gray\">(chapter)</span> like it)</span><span class=\"gray\">(10:38)</span> this includes the short and long Surahs of the Qur'an. Therefore, the challenge to creation stands with regards to both the long and short Surahs, and there is no disagreement that I know of on this fact between the scholars of old and new. Before he became Muslim, 'Amr bin Al-'As met Musaylimah the Liar who asked him, \"What has recently been revealed to your fellow <span class=\"gray\">(meaning Muhammad ﷺ)</span> in Makkah?\" 'Amr said, \"A short, yet eloquent Surah.\" He asked, \"What is it?\" He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْعَصْرِ - إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By Al-'Asr <span class=\"gray\">(the time)</span>. Verily, man is in loss,)</span><span class=\"gray\">(103:1-2)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Musaylimah thought for a while and said, \"A similar Surah was also revealed to me.\" 'Amr asked, \"What is it?\" He said, \"O Wabr, O Wabr <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. a wild cat)</span>, you are but two ears and a chest, and the rest of you is unworthy and thin.\" 'Amr said, \"By Allah! You know that I know that you are lying.\"</p>"
