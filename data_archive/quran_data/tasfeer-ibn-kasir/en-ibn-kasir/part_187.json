This is as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَوْ تَرَىٰ إِذِ الْمُجْرِمُونَ نَاكِسُو رُءُوسِهِمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ رَبَّنَا أَبْصَرْنَا وَسَمِعْنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if you only could see when the criminals hang their heads before their Lord <span class=\"gray\">(saying)</span>: \"Our Lord!

If they had used these senses properly before seeing the torment, then it would have brought them some benefit and saved them from the Allah's punishment. This is why Allah says,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(How clearly will they <span class=\"gray\">(disbelievers)</span> see and hear,)</span> This means that no one will hear and see better than they will.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَأْتُونَنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(the day when they will appear before Us.)</span> The Day of Resurrection.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَٰكِنِ الظَّالِمُونَ الْيَوْمَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But the wrongdoers today are...)</span> now, in the life of this world,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِي ضَلَالٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...in plain error.)</span> They do not hear, see or think. When they are requested to follow guidance, they are not guided and they succumb to those things that do not benefit them. Then, Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَنذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْحَسْرَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And warn them of the Day of grief and regrets,)</span> warn the creation of the Day of Distress,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذْ قُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(when the case has been decided,)</span> when the people of Paradise and the people of Hell will be sorted out, and everyone will reach his final abode which he was destined to remain in forever.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(while <span class=\"gray\">(now)</span> they are)</span> today, in the present life of this world,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِي غَفْلَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(in a state of carelessness.)</span> with the warning of the Day of grief and regret, they are heedless.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and they believe not.)</span> meaning they do not believe that it is true.</p><p lang=\"hmn\" class=\"hmn \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa'id said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ وَأَهْلُ النَّارِ النَّارَ، يُجَاءُ بِالْمَوْتِ كَأَنَّهُ كَبْشٌ أَمْلَحُ فَيُوقَفُ بَيْنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَالنَّارِ، فَيُقَالُ: يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ هَلْ تَعْرِفُونَ هَذَا، قَالَ: فَيَشْرَئِبُّونَ وَيَنْظُرُونَ وَيَقُولُونَ: نَعَمْ هَذَا الْمَوْتُ - قَالَ: - فَيُقَالُ: يَاأَهْلَ النَّارِ، هَلْ تَعْرِفُونَ هَذَا؟ قَالَ: فَيَشْرَئِبُّونَ وَيَنْظُرُونَ وَيَقُولُونَ: نَعَمْ هَذَا الْمَوْتُ - قَالَ: - فَيُؤْمَرُ بِهِ فَيُذْبَحُ، قَالَ: وَيُقَالُ: يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ، خُلُودٌ وَلَا مَوْتَ، وَيَا أَهْلَ النَّارِ، خُلُودٌ وَلَا مَوْتَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When the people of Paradise enter Paradise and the people of the Hellfire enter the Hellfire, death will be brought in the form of a handsome ram and it will be placed between Paradise and the Hellfire.

So the people of the Hellfire will see the residence that Allah prepared for them if they had believed. Then, it will be said to them, 'If you had believed and worked righteous deeds, you would have had this, which you see in Paradise.' Then, they will be overcome with distress and grief. Likewise, the people of Paradise will see the residence that is in the Hellfire and it will be said to them, 'If Allah had not bestowed His favor upon you <span class=\"gray\">(this would have been your place)</span>.'\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَرِثُ الْأَرْضَ وَمَنْ عَلَيْهَا وَإِلَيْنَا يُرْجَعُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, We will inherit the earth and whatsoever is thereon.

All of the creation will be destroyed and only He, the Most High and Most Holy, will remain. There is no one who can claim absolute ownership and control of affairs besides Him. He is the Inheritor of all His creation. He is the Eternal, Who will remain after they are gone and He is the Judge of their affairs. Therefore, no soul will be done any injustice, nor wronged even the weight of a mosquito or an atom.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Hazm bin Abi Hazm Al-Quta'i said, \"'Umar bin 'Abdul-Aziz wrote to 'Abdul-Hamid bin 'Abdur-Rahman, who was the governor of Kufah: 'Thus, to proceed: Verily, Allah prescribed death for His creatures when He created them and He determined their final destination. He said in that which He revealed in His truthful Book, which He guarded with His knowledge and made His angels testify to its preservation, that He will inherit the earth and all who are on it, and they will all be returned to Him.'\"</p>"
