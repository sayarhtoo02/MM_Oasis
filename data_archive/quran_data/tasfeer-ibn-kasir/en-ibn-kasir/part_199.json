Also, in the last Hadith, Allah said, \"I have divided the prayer between Myself and My servant into two halves, a half for Me and a half for My servant. My servant shall have what he asked for.\" Allah next explained the division that involves reciting Al-Fatihah, demonstrating the importance of reciting the Qur'an during the prayer, which is one of the prayer's greatest pillars. Hence, the word 'prayer' was used here although only a part of it was actually being referred to, that is, reciting the Qur'an. Similarly, the word 'recite' was used where prayer is meant, as demonstrated by Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقُرْءَانَ الْفَجْرِ إِنَّ قُرْءَانَ الْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُودًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And recite the Qur'an in the early dawn.Verily, the recitation of the Qur'an in the early dawn is ever witnessed.)</span> in reference to the Fajr prayer. The Two Sahihs recorded that the angels of the night and the day attend this prayer.</p><div lang=\"sn\" class=\"sn \"><h2>Reciting Al-Fatihah is required in Every Rak'ah of the Prayer</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">All of these facts testify to the requirement that reciting the Qur'an <span class=\"gray\">(Al-Fatihah)</span> in the prayer is required, and there is a consensus between the scholars on this ruling. The Hadith that we mentioned also testifies to this fact, for the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ صَلَّى صَلَاةً لَمْ يَقْرَأْ فِيهَا بِأُمِّ الْقُرْآنِ فَهِيَ خِدَاجٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever performs any prayer in which he did not recite Umm Al-Qur'an, his prayer is incomplete.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Also, the Two Sahihs recorded that 'Ubadah bin As-Samit said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا صَلَاةَ لِمَنْ لَمْ يَقْرَأْ بِفَاتِحَةِ الْكِتَابِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is no prayer for whoever does not recite the Opening of the Book.)</span></p><p lang=\"fil\" class=\"fil \">Also, the Sahihs of Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا تُجْزِئُ صَلَاةٌ لَا يُقْرَأُ فِيهَا بِأُمِّ الْقُرآنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The prayer during which Umm Al-Qur'an is not recited is invalid.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There are many other Hadiths on this subject. Therefore, reciting the Opening of the Book, during the prayer by the Imam and those praying behind him, is required in every prayer, and in every Rak'ah.</p><div lang=\"yo\" class=\"yo \"><h2>The Tafsir of Isti'adhah <span class=\"ig gray\" lang=\"ig\">(seeking Refuge)</span></h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خُذِ الْعَفْوَ وَأْمُرْ بِالْعُرْفِ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ الْجَاهِلِينَ - وَإِمَّا يَنزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and stay away from the foolish <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. don't punish them)</span>.

Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(41:34-36)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">These are the only three Ayat that carry this meaning. Allah commanded that we be lenient against our human enemy, so that his soft nature might make him an ally and a supporter. He also commanded that we seek refuge from the satanic enemy, because the devil does not relent in his enmity if we treat him with kindness and leniency. The devil only seeks the destruction of the Son of Adam due to the vicious enmity and hatred he has always had towards man's father, Adam. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا بَنِي آدَمَ لَا يَفْتِنَنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ كَمَا أَخْرَجَ أَبَوَيْكُم مِّنَ الْجَنَّةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Children of Adam!

Similarly, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ فَاغْسِلُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When you intend to offer As-Salah <span class=\"gray\">(the prayer)</span>, wash your faces and your hands <span class=\"gray\">(forearms)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">(5:6)</span> meaning, before you stand in prayer, as evident by the Hadiths that we mentioned. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri said, \"When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would stand up in prayer at night, he would start his prayer with the Takbir <span class=\"gray\">(saying \"Allahu Akbar\"; Allah is Greater)</span> and would then supplicate,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ، وَتَبَارَكَ اسْمُكَ، وَتَعَالَى جَدُّكَ، وَلَا إِلَهَ غَيْرُكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(All praise is due to You, O Allah, and also the thanks.

I seek refuge with You from the cursed devil, from his Hamz, Nafkh and Nafth.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He said, \"The Hamz means death, the Nafkh means arrogance, and the Nafth means poetry.\"</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Seeking Refuge with Allah when One is Angry</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In his Musnad, Al-Hafiz Abu Ya'la Ahmad bin 'Ali bin Al-Muthanna Al-Mawsili reported that Ubayy bin Ka'b said, \"Two men disputed with each other in the presence of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and the nose of one of them became swollen because of extreme anger. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنِّي لَأَعْلَمُ شَيْئًا لَوْ قَالَهُ لَذَهَبَ عَنْهُ مَا يَجِدُ: أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I know of some words that if he said them, what he feels will go away, 'I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.')</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith in his book, Al-Yawm wal-Laylah.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari recorded that Sulayman bin Surad said, \"Two men disputed in the presence of the Prophet ﷺ while we were sitting with him. One of them was cursing the other fellow and his face turned red due to anger. The Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنِّي لَأَعْلَمُ كَلِمَةً لَوْ قَالَهَا لَذَهَبَ عَنْهُ مَا يَجِدُ، لَوْ قَالَ: أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I know of a statement which if he said it, will make what he feels disappear, 'I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.')</span> They said to the man, 'Do you not hear what the Messenger of Allah is saying?' He said, 'I am not insane.'\" Also, Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i recorded this Hadith.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There are many other Hadiths about seeking refuge with Allah. One can find this subject in the books on supplication and the virtues of righteous, good deeds.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Is the Isti'adhah <span class=\"ig gray\" lang=\"ig\">(seeking Refuge)</span> required?</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The majority of the scholars state that reciting the Isti'adhah <span class=\"gray\">(in the prayer and when reciting the Qur'an)</span> is recommended and not required, and therefore, not reciting it does not constitute a sin. However, Ar-Razi recorded that 'Ata' bin Abi Rabah said that the Isti'adhah is required in the prayer and when one reads the Qur'an. In support of 'Ata's statement, Ar-Razi relied upon the apparent meaning of the Ayah,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">فَاسْتَعِذْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then seek refuge.)</span> He said that the Ayah contains a command that requires implementation. Also, the Prophet ﷺ always said the Isti'adhah. In addition, the Isti'adhah wards off the evil of Satan, which is neccessary, the rule is that the means needed to implement a requirement of the religion is itself also required. And when one says, \"I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed devil.\" Then this will suffice.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Virtues of the Isti'adhah</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Isti'adhah cleanses the mouth from the foul speech that it has indulged in. It also purifies the mouth and prepares it to recite the speech of Allah. Further, the Isti'adhah entails seeking Allah's help and acknowledging His ability to do everything. The Isti'adhah also affirms the servant's meekness, weakness and inability to face the enemy of his inner evil, whom Allah alone, Who created this enemy, is able to repel and defeat. This enemy does not accept kindness, unlike the human enemy. There are three Ayat in the Qur'an that affirm this fact. Also, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ عِبَادِي لَيْسَ لَكَ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَانٌ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِرَبِّكَ وَكِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, My servants <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism)</span> ـ you have no authority over them. And sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:65)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">We should state here that the believers, whom the human enemies kill, become martyrs, while those who fall victim to the inner enemy - Satan - become bandits. Further, the believers who are defeated by the apparent enemy - disbelievers - gain a reward, while those defeated by the inner enemy earn a sin and become misguided. Since Satan sees man where man cannot see him, it is befitting that the believers seek refuge from Satan with Whom Satan cannot see. The Isti'adhah is a form of drawing closer to Allah and seeking refuge with Him from the evil of every evil creature.</p><div lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \"><h2>What does Isti'adhah mean?</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Isti'adhah means, \"I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan so that he is prevented from affecting my religious or worldly affairs, or hindering me from adhering to what I was commanded, or luring me into what I was prohibited from.\" Indeed, only Allah is able to prevent the evil of Satan from touching the son of Adam. This is why Allah allowed us to be lenient and kind with the human devil, so that his soft nature might cause him to refrain from the evil he is indulging in. However, Allah required us to seek refuge with Him from the evil of Satan, because he neither accepts bribes nor does kindness affect him, for he is pure evil. Thus, only He Who created Satan is able to stop his evil. This meaning is reiterated in only three Ayat in the Qur'an. Allah said in Surat Al-A'raf,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خُذِ الْعَفْوَ وَأْمُرْ بِالْعُرْفِ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ الْجَاهِلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. don't punish them)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7:199)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is about dealing with human beings. He then said in the same Surah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِمَّا يَنزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing <span class=\"gray\">(7:200)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"it\" class=\"it \">Allah also said in Surat Al-Mu'minun,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ السَّيِّئَةَ ۚ نَحْنُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَصِفُونَ - وَقُل رَّبِّ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ هَمَزَاتِ الشَّيَاطِينِ - وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ رَبِّ أَن يَحْضُرُونِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Repel evil with that which is better.

And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.\" <span class=\"gray\">(23:96-98)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"id\" class=\"id \">Further, Allah said in Surat As-Sajdah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَسْتَوِي الْحَسَنَةُ وَلَا السَّيِّئَةُ ۚ ادْفَعْ بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ فَإِذَا الَّذِي بَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَهُ عَدَاوَةٌ كَأَنَّهُ وَلِيٌّ حَمِيمٌ - وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلَّا الَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلَّا ذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ - وَإِمَّا يَنزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ ۖ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal.

But none is granted it <span class=\"gray\">(the above quality)</span> except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion <span class=\"gray\">(of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character)</span> in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away <span class=\"gray\">(from doing good)</span>, then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing)</span><span class=\"gray\">(41:34-36)</span>.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Why the Devil is called Shaytan</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In the Arabic language, Shaytan is derived from Shatana, which means the far thing. Hence, the Shaytan has a different nature than mankind, and his sinful ways are far away from every type of righteousness. It was also said that Shaytan is derived from Shata, <span class=\"gray\">(literally 'burned')</span>, because it was created from fire. Some scholars said that both meanings are correct, although they state that the first meaning is more plausible. Further, Siybawayh <span class=\"gray\">(the renowned Arab linguistic)</span> said, \"The Arabs say, 'So-and-so has Tashaytan,' when he commits the act of the devils.

They disagree over whether it is a separate Ayah before every Surah, or if it is an Ayah, or a part of an Ayah, included in every Surah where the Bismillah appears in its beginning. Ad-Daraqutni also recorded a Hadith from Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet ﷺ that supports this Hadith by Ibn Khuzaymah. Also, similar statements were attributed to 'Ali, Ibn 'Abbas and others.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The opinion that Bismillah is an Ayah of every Surah, except Al-Bara'ah <span class=\"gray\">(chapter 9)</span>, was attributed to <span class=\"gray\">(the Companions)</span> Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn 'Umar, Ibn Az-Zubayr, Abu Hurayrah and 'Ali. This opinion was also attributed to the Tabi'in: 'Ata', Tawus, Sa'id bin Jubayr, Makhul and Az-Zuhri. This is also the view of 'Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak, Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad bin Hanbal, <span class=\"gray\">(in one report from him)</span> Ishaq bin Rahwayh and Abu 'Ubayd Al-Qasim bin Salam. On the other hand, Malik, Abu Hanifah and their followers said that Bismillah is not an Ayah in Al-Fatihah or any other Surah.

The scholars who stated that Bismillah is a part of every Surah <span class=\"gray\">(except chapter 9)</span> had different opinions; some of them, such as Ash-Shafi'i, said that one should recite Bismillah with Al-Fatihah aloud. This is also the opinion of many among the Companions, the Tabi'in and the Imams of Muslims from the Salaf and the later generations. For instance, this is the opinion of Abu Hurayrah, Ibn 'Umar, Ibn 'Abbas, Mu'awiyah, 'Umar and 'Ali - according to Ibn 'Abdul-Barr and Al-Bayhaqi. Also, the Four Khalifahs - as Al-Khatib reported - were said to have held this view although the report from them is contradicted. The Tabi'in scholars who gave this Tafsir include Sa'id bin Jubayr, 'Ikrimah, Abu Qilabah, Az-Zuhri, 'Ali bin Al-Hasan, his son Muhammad, Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib, 'Ata', Tawus, Mujahid, Salim, Muhammad bin Ka'b Al-Qurazi, Abu Bakr bin Muhammad bin 'Amr bin Hazm, Abu Wa'il, Ibn Sirin, Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir, 'Ali bin 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas, his son Muhammad, Nafi' the freed slave of Ibn 'Umar, Zayd bin Aslam, 'Umar bin 'Abdul-Aziz, Al-Azraq bin Qays, Habib bin Abi Thabit, Abu Ash-Sha'tha', Makhul and 'Abdullah bin Ma'qil bin Muqarrin. Also, Al-Bayhaqi added 'Abdullah bin Safwan, and Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah to this list. In addition, Ibn 'Abdul-Barr added 'Amr bin Dinar.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The proof that these scholars relied on is that, since Bismillah is a part of Al-Fatihah, it should be recited aloud like the rest of Al-Fatihah. Also, An-Nasa'i recorded in his Sunan, Ibn Hibban and Ibn Khuzaymah in their Sahihs and Al-Hakim in the Mustadrak, that Abu Hurayrah once performed the prayer and recited Bismillah aloud. After he finished the prayer, he said, \"Among you, I perform the prayer that is the closest to the prayer of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.\" Ad-Daraqutni, Al-Khatib and Al-Bayhaqi graded this Hadith Sahih Furthermore, in Sahih Al-Bukhari it is recorded that Anas bin Malik was asked about the recitation of the Prophet ﷺ. He said, \"His recitation was unhurried.\" He then demonstrated that and recited, while lengthening the recitation of Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim, Also, in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad, the Sunan of Abu Dawud, the Sahih of Ibn Hibban and the Mustadrak of Al-Hakim - it is recorded that Umm Salamah said, \"The Messenger of Allah used to distinguish each Ayah during his recitation,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ - الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ - الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ - مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

The Muhajirin who were present at that prayer criticized that. When Mu'awiyah led the following prayer, he recited the Bismillah aloud.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Hadiths mentioned above provide sufficient proof for the opinion that the Bismillah is recited aloud. As for the opposing evidences and the scientific analysis of the narrations mentioned their weaknesses or otherwise it is not our desire to discuss this subject at this time.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Other scholars stated that the Bismillah should not be recited aloud in the prayer, and this is the established practice of the Four Khalifahs, as well as 'Abdullah bin Mughaffal and several scholars among the Tabi'in and later generations. It is also the Madhhab <span class=\"gray\">(view)</span> of Abu Hanifah, Ath-Thawri and Ahmad bin Hanbal.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Malik stated that the Bismillah is not recited aloud or silently. This group based their view upon what Imam Muslim recorded that 'A'ishah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to start the prayer by reciting the Takbir <span class=\"gray\">(Allahu Akbar; Allah is Greater)</span> and then recite,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(Ibn Abi Hatim 1:12)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Also, the Two Sahihs recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"I prayed behind the Prophet ﷺ, Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman and they used to start their prayer with,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(All praise and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Muslim added, \"And they did not mention,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful)</span> whether in the beginning or the end of the recitation.\" Similar is recorded in the Sunan books from 'Abdullah bin Mughaffal, may Allah be pleased with him.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">These are the opinions held by the respected Imams, and their statements are similar in that they agree that the prayer of those who recite Al-Fatihah aloud or in secret is correct.

The Prophet ﷺ said in this narration,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا تَقُلْ هٰكَذَا فَإِنَّهُ يَتَعَاظَمُ حَتَّى يَكُونَ كَالْبَيْتِ، وَلٰكِنْ قُلْ: بِسْمِ اللهِ، فَإنَّهُ يَصْغَرُ حَتَّى يَكُونَ كَالذُّبَابَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do not say these words, because then Satan becomes larger; as large as a house.

For instance, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلِ ادْعُوا اللَّهَ أَوِ ادْعُوا الرَّحْمَٰنَ ۖ أَيًّا مَّا تَدْعُوا فَلَهُ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad ﷺ)</span>: \"Invoke Allah or invoke Ar-Rahman <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span>, by whatever name you invoke Him <span class=\"gray\">(it is the same)</span>, for to Him belong the Best Names)</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:110)</span>,) and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاسْأَلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَا أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ آلِهَةً يُعْبَدُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And ask <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad ﷺ)</span> those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: \"Did We ever appoint alihah <span class=\"gray\">(gods)</span> to be worshipped besides Ar-Rahman <span class=\"gray\">(Most Gracious, Allah)</span>?\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(43:45)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Further, when Musaylimah the Liar called himself the Rahman of Yamamah, Allah made him known by the name 'Liar' and exposed him. Hence, whenever Musaylimah is mentioned, he is described as 'the Liar'. He became an example for lying among the residents of the cities and villages and the residents of the deserts, the bedouins.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, Allah first mentioned His Name - Allah - that is exclusively His and described this Name by Ar-Rahman, which no one else is allowed to use, just as Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلِ ادْعُوا اللَّهَ أَوِ ادْعُوا الرَّحْمَٰنَ ۖ أَيًّا مَّا تَدْعُوا فَلَهُ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad ﷺ)</span>: \"Invoke Allah or invoke Ar-Rahman <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span>, by whatever name you invoke Him <span class=\"gray\">(it is the same)</span>, for to Him belong the Best Names.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:110)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Only Musaylimah and those who followed his misguided ways described Musaylimah by Ar-Rahman.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">As for Allah's Name Ar-Rahim, Allah has described others by it. For instance, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger <span class=\"gray\">(Muhammad ﷺ)</span> from amongst yourselves <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. whom you know well)</span>.

For instance, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّا خَلَقْنَا الْإِنسَانَ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ أَمْشَاجٍ نَّبْتَلِيهِ فَجَعَلْنَاهُ سَمِيعًا بَصِيرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, We have created man from Nutfah <span class=\"gray\">(drops)</span> of mixed semen <span class=\"gray\">(sexual discharge of man and woman)</span>, in order to try him, so We made him hearer <span class=\"gray\">(Sami')</span> and seer <span class=\"gray\">(Basir)</span><span class=\"gray\">(76:2)</span>.</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In conclusion, there are several of Allah's Names that are used as names for others besides Allah. Further, some of Allah's Names are exclusive for Allah alone, such as Allah, Ar-Rahman, Al-Khaliq <span class=\"gray\">(the Creator)</span>, Ar-Raziq <span class=\"gray\">(the Sustainer)</span>, and so forth.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Hence, Allah started the Tasmiyah <span class=\"gray\">(meaning, 'In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious Most Merciful')</span> with His Name, Allah, and described Himself as Ar-Rahman, <span class=\"gray\">(Most Gracious)</span> which is softer and more general than Ar-Rahim. The most honorable Names are mentioned first, just as Allah did here.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">A Hadith narrated by Umm Salamah stated that the recitation of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was slow and clear, letter by letter,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ - الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ - الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ - مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

These thanks are due to Allah's innumerable favors and bounties, that only He knows the amount of. Allah's bounties include creating the tools that help the creation worship Him, the physical bodies with which they are able to implement His commands, the sustenance that He provides them in this life, and the comfortable life He has granted them, without anything or anyone compelling Him to do so. Allah also warned His creation and alerted them about the means and methods with which they can earn eternal dwelling in the residence of everlasting happiness. All thanks and praise are due to Allah for these favors from beginning to end.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Further, Ibn Jarir commented on the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Al-Hamdu Lillah)</span>, that it means, \"A praise that Allah praised Himself with, indicating to His servants that they too should praise Him, as if Allah had said, 'Say: All thanks and praise is due to Allah.'

The word 'Alam is itself a plural word, having no singular form. The 'Alamin are different creations that exist in the heavens and the earth, on land and at sea. Every generation of creation is called an 'Alam. Al-Farra' and Abu 'Ubayd said, \"'Alam includes all that has a mind, the Jinns, mankind, the angels and the devils, but not the animals.\" Also, Zayd bin Aslam and Abu Muhaysin said, 'Alam includes all that Allah has created with a soul.\" Further, Qatadah said about,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبِّ الْعَــٰـلَمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Lord of the 'Alamin)</span>, \"Every type of creation is an 'Alam.\" Az-Zajjaj also said, \"Alam encompasses everything that Allah created, in this life and in the Hereafter.\" Al-Qurtubi commented, \"This is the correct meaning, that the 'Alam encompasses everything that Allah created in both worlds.

Hence the Arabs would describe the honest person as being straight and the wicked person as being crooked.

The servant does not have the power to benefit or harm himself, except by Allah's permission. Therefore, Allah directed the servant to invoke Him constantly, so that He provides him with His aid and with firmness and success. Indeed, the happy person is he whom Allah guides to ask of Him. This is especially the case if a person urgently needs Allah's help day or night.

They are the people who adhere to Allah's commandments and refrain from committing what He has prohibited. But, help us to avoid the path of those whom Allah is angry with, whose intentions are corrupt, who know the truth, yet deviate from it. Also, help us avoid the path of those who were led astray, who lost the true knowledge and, as a result, are wandering in misguidance, unable to find the correct path. Allah asserted that the two paths He described here are both misguided when He repeated the negation 'not'. These two paths are the paths of the Christians and Jews, a fact that the believer should beware of so that he avoids them. The path of the believers is knowledge of the truth and abiding by it. In comparison, the Jews abandoned practicing the religion, while the Christians lost the true knowledge. This is why 'anger' descended upon the Jews, while being described as 'led astray' is more appropriate of the Christians. Those who know, but avoid implementing the truth, deserve the anger, unlike those who are ignorant. The Christians want to seek the true knowledge, but are unable to find it because they did not seek it from its proper resources. This is why they were led astray. We should also mention that both the Christians and the Jews have earned the anger and are led astray, but the anger is one of the attributes more particular of the Jews. Allah said about the Jews,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَن لَّعَنَهُ اللَّهُ وَغَضِبَ عَلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those <span class=\"gray\">(Jews)</span> who incurred the curse of Allah and His wrath)</span><span class=\"gray\">(5:60)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The attribute that the Christians deserve most is that of being led astray, just as Allah said about them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قَدْ ضَلُّوا مِن قَبْلُ وَأَضَلُّوا كَثِيرًا وَضَلُّوا عَن سَوَاءِ السَّبِيلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who went astray before and who misled many, and strayed <span class=\"gray\">(themselves)</span> from the right path)</span><span class=\"gray\">(5:77)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There are several Hadiths and reports from the Salaf on this subject. Imam Ahmad recorded that 'Adi bin Hatim said, \"The horsemen of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ seized my paternal aunt and some other people. When they brought them to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, they were made to stand in line before him. My aunt said, 'O Messenger of Allah! The supporter is far away, the offspring have stopped coming and I am an old woman, unable to serve. Grant me your favor, may Allah grant you His favor.' He said, 'Who is your supporter' She said, 'Adi bin Hatim.' He said, 'The one who ran away from Allah and His Messenger' She said, 'So, the Prophet ﷺ freed me.' When the Prophet ﷺ came back, there was a man next to him, I think that he was 'Ali, who said to her, 'Ask him for a means of transportation.' She asked the Prophet ﷺ, and he ordered that she be given an animal.'' 'Adi then said, \"Later on, she came to me and said, 'He <span class=\"gray\">(Muhammad ﷺ)</span> has done a favor that your father <span class=\"gray\">(who was a generous man)</span> would never have done. So and-so person came to him and he granted him his favor, and so-and-so came to him and he granted him his favor.' So I went to the Prophet ﷺ and found that some women and children were gathering with him, so close that I knew that he was not a king like Kisra <span class=\"gray\">(King of Persia)</span> or Caesar. He said, 'O 'Adi! What made you run away, so that La ilaha illallah is not proclaimed? Is there a deity worthy of worship except Allah? What made you run away, so that Allahu Akbar <span class=\"gray\">(Allah is the Greater)</span> is not proclaimed? Is there anything Greater than Allah?' I proclaimed my Islam and I saw his face radiate with pleasure and he said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ الْمَغْضُوبَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْيَهُودُ وَ إِنَّ الضَّالِينَ النَّصَارَى</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who have earned the anger are the Jews and those who are led astray are the Christians.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Hadith was also collected by At-Tirmidhi who said that it is Hasan Gharib.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Also, when Zayd bin 'Amr bin Nufayl went with some of his friends - before Islam - to Ash-Sham seeking the true religion, the Jews said to him, \"You will not become a Jew unless you carry a share of the anger of Allah that we have earned.\" He said, \"I am seeking to escape Allah's anger.\" Also, the Christians said to him, \"If you become one of us you will carry a share in Allah's discontent.\" He said, \"I cannot bear it.\" So he remained in his pure nature and avoided worshipping the idols and the polytheistic practices. He became neither a Jew, nor Christian. As for his companions, they became Christians because they found it more pure than Judaism. Waraqah bin Nawfal was among these people until Allah guided him by the hand of His Prophet ﷺ, when he was sent as Prophet, and Waraqah believed in the revelation that was sent to the Prophet ﷺ may Allah be pleased with him.</p><div lang=\"sn\" class=\"sn \"><h2>The Summary of Al-Fatihah</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The honorable Surah Al-Fatihah contains seven Ayat including the praise and thanks of Allah, glorifying Him and praising Him by mentioning His most Beautiful Names and most high Attributes. It also mentions the Hereafter, which is the Day of Resurrection, and directs Allah's servants to ask of Him, invoking Him and declaring that all power and strength comes from Him. It also calls to the sincerity of the worship of Allah alone, singling Him out in His divinity, believing in His perfection, being free from the need of any partners, having no rivals nor equals. Al-Fatihah directs the believers to invoke Allah to guide them to the straight path, which is the true religion, and to help them remain on that path in this life, and to pass over the actual Sirat <span class=\"gray\">(bridge over hell that everyone must pass over)</span> on the Day of Judgment. On that Day, the believers will be directed to the gardens of comfort in the company of the Prophets, the truthful ones, the martyrs and the righteous. Al-Fatihah also encourages performing good deeds, so that the believers will be in the company of the good-doers on the Day of Resurrection. The Surah also warns against following the paths of misguidance, so that one does not end up being gathered with those who indulge in sin, on the Day of Resurrection, including those who have earned the anger and those who were led astray.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Bounties are because of Allah, not the Deviations</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The way of those upon whom you have bestowed Your grace)</span>, when He mentioned His favor. On mentioning anger, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Not <span class=\"gray\">(that)</span> of those who earned Your anger)</span>, without mentioning the subject, although it is He Who has sent down the anger on them, just as Allah stated in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ تَوَلَّوْا قَوْمًا غَضِبَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Have you <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad ﷺ)</span> not seen those <span class=\"gray\">(hypocrites)</span> who take as friends a people upon whom is the wrath of Allah <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. Jews)</span>?)</span><span class=\"gray\">(58:14)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Also, Allah relates the misguidance of those who indulged in it, although they were justly misguided according to Allah's appointed destiny. For instance, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَن يَهْدِ اللَّهُ فَهُوَ الْمُهْتَدِ وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ وَلِيًّا مُّرْشِدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He whom Allah guides, he is the rightly-guided; but he whom He sends astray, for him you will find no Wali <span class=\"gray\">(guiding friend)</span> to lead him <span class=\"gray\">(to the right path)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">(18:17)</span></p><p>and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَن يُضْلِلِ اللَّهُ فَلاَ هَادِيَ لَهُ وَيَذَرُهُمْ فِى طُغْيَـٰـنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whomsoever Allah sends astray, none can guide him; and He lets them wander blindly in their transgression)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7:186)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">These and several other Ayat testify to the fact that Allah alone is the One Who guides and misguides, contrary to the belief of the Qadariyyah sect, who claimed that the servants choose and create their own destiny. They rely on some unclear Ayat avoiding what is clear and contradicts their desires. Theirs, is the method of the people who follow their lust, desire and wickedness. An authentic Hadith narrated,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا رَأَيْتُمُ الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَابَهَ مِنْهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ سَمَّى اللهُ فَاحْذَرُوهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When you see those who follow what is not so clear in it <span class=\"gray\">(the Qur'an)</span>, then they are those whom Allah has mentioned <span class=\"gray\">(refer to 3:7)</span>. Hence, avoid them.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Prophet ﷺ was referring to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فى قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَـٰــبَهَ مِنْهُ ابْتِغَآءَ الْفِتْنَةِ وَابْتِغَآءَ تَأْوِيلِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation <span class=\"gray\">(from the truth)</span> they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking Al-Fitnah <span class=\"gray\">(polytheism and trials)</span>, and seeking for its hidden meanings)</span><span class=\"gray\">(3:7)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Verily, no innovator in the religion could ever rely on any authentic evidence in the Qur'an that testifies to his innovation. The Qur'an came to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and guidance and misguidance. The Qur'an does not contain any discrepancies or contradictions, because it is a revelation from the Most Wise, Worthy of all praise.</p><div lang=\"fil\" class=\"fil \"><h2>Saying Amin</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It is recommended to say Amin after finishing the recitation of Al-Fatihah. Amin means, \"O Allah! Accept our invocation.\" The evidence that saying Amin is recommended is contained in what Imams Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi recorded, that Wa'il bin Hujr said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recite,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ الضَّآلِّينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Not <span class=\"gray\">(that)</span> of those who earned Your anger, nor of those who went astray)</span>, and he said 'Amin' extending it with his voice.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abu Dawud's narration added, \"Raising his voice with it.\" At-Tirmidhi then commented that this Hadith is Hasan and was also narrated from 'Ali and Ibn Mas'ud. Also, Abu Hurayrah narrated that whenever the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would recite,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ الضَّآلِّينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Not <span class=\"gray\">(the way)</span> of those who earned Your anger, nor of those who went astray)</span>, He would say Amin until those who were behind him in the first line could hear him.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded this Hadith with the addition, \"Then the Masjid would shake because of <span class=\"gray\">(those behind the Prophet ﷺ)</span> reciting Amin.\" Also, Ad-Daraqutni recorded this Hadith and commented that it is Hasan. Further, Bilal narrated that he said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Do not finish saying Amin before I can join you.\" This was recorded by Abu Dawud.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In addition, Abu Nasr Al-Qushayri narrated that Al-Hasan and Ja'far As-Sadiq stressed the 'm' in Amin.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Saying Amin is recommended for those who are not praying <span class=\"gray\">(when reciting Al-Fatihah)</span> and is strongly recommended for those who are praying, whether alone or behind the Imam. The Two Sahihs recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا أَمَّنَ الْإِمَامُ فَأَمِّنُوا، فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ وَافَقَ تَأْمِينُهُ تَأْمِينَ الْمَلَائِكَةِ غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When the Imam says, ' Amin', then say, 'Amin', because whoever says, Amin' with the angels, his previous sins will be forgiven.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Muslim recorded that the Messenger of Allah <span class=\"gray\">(ﷺ)</span> said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا قَالَ أَحَدُكُمْ فِي الصَّلَاةِ: آمِينَ، وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ فِي السَّمَاءِ: آمِينَ، فَوَافَقَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا الْأُخْرَى غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When any of you says in the prayer, 'Amin ' and the angels in heaven say, 'Amin', in unison, his previous sins will be forgiven.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">It was said that the Hadith talks about both the angels and the Muslims saying Amin at the same time. The Hadith also refers to when the Amins said by the angels and the Muslims are equally sincere <span class=\"gray\">(thus bringing about forgiveness)</span>. Further, it is recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Musa related to the Prophet ﷺ that he said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا قَالَ - يَعنِي الْإِمَامَ - : وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ، فَقُولُوا: آمِينَ، يُجِبْكُمُ اللهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When the Imam says, 'Walad-dallin', say, 'Amin' and Allah will answer your invocation.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In addition, At-Tirmidhi said that 'Amin' means, \"Do not disappoint our hope\", while the majority of scholars said that it means. \"Answer our invocation.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Also, in his Musnad, Imam Ahmad recorded that 'A'ishah said that when the Jews were mentioned to him, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّهُم لَنْ يَحْسُدُونَا عَلَى شَيْءٍ كَمَا يَحْسُدُونَا عَلَى الْجُمُعَةِ الَّتِي هَدَانَا اللهُ لَهَا وَضَلُّوا عَنْهَا، وَعَلَى الْقِبْلَةِ الَّتِي هَدَانَا اللهُ لَهَا وَضَلُّوا عَنْهَا وَعَلَى قَوْلِنَا خَلْفَ الْإِمَامِ: آمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They will not envy us for anything more than they envy us for Friday which we have been guided to, while they were led astray from it, and for the Qiblah which we were guided to, while they were led astray from it, and for our saying 'Amin' behind the Imam.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Also, Ibn Majah recorded this Hadith with the wording,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا حَسَدَتْكُمُ الْيَهُودُ عَلَى شَيْءٍ مَا حَسَدَتْكُمْ عَلَى السَّلَامِ وَالتَّأْمِينِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Jews have never envied you more than for your saying the Salam <span class=\"gray\">(Islamic greeting)</span> and for saying Amin.)</span></p>"
