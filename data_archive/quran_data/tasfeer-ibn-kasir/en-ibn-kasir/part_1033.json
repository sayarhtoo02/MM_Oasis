They are those who obeyed Allah and did not meet Him with disobedience <span class=\"gray\">(sins)</span>. Then He mentions that the evildoers will be in Hell and eternal torment. Due to this He says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَصْلَوْنَهَا يَوْمَ الدِّينِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Therein they will enter, and taste its burning flame on the Day of Recompense,)</span> meaning, the Day of Reckoning, Recompense, and Judgement.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَمَا هُمْ عَنْهَا بِغَائِبِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they will not be absent therefrom.)</span> meaning, they will not be absent for even one hour from the torment. The torment will not be lightened from them, nor will they be granted the death that they will be requesting, or any rest – not even for a single day. Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الدِّينِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is?)</span> This is a magnification of the affair of the Day of Judgement. Then Allah affirms it by saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ مَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الدِّينِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Again, what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is?)</span> Then He explains this by saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ لَا تَمْلِكُ نَفْسٌ لِّنَفْسٍ شَيْئًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(It will be)</span> the Day when no person shall have power for another,)</span> meaning, no one will be able to benefit anyone else, or help him out of that which he will be in, unless Allah gives permission to whomever He wishes and is pleased with. We will mention here a Hadith <span class=\"gray\">(where the Prophet ﷺ said)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا بَنِي هَاشِم، أَنْقِذُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ مِنَ النَّارِ لَا أَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ مِنَ اللهِ شَيْئًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O children of Hashim! Save yourselves from the Fire, for I have no power to cause you any benefit from Allah.)</span> This has been mentioned previously at the end of the Tafsir of Surat Ash-Shu'ara' <span class=\"gray\">(see 26:214)</span>.

The Day when <span class=\"gray\">(all)</span> mankind will stand before the Lord of all that exists?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Increasing and decreasing in the Measure and Weight will be a Cause for Regret and Loss</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah both recorded from Ibn 'Abbas that he said, \"When the Prophet ﷺ came to Al-Madinah, the people of Al-Madinah were the most terrible people in giving measurement <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., they used to cheat)</span>. Thus, Allah revealed,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيْلٌ لِّلْمُطَفِّفِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Woe to Al-Mutaffifin.)</span> After this, they began to give good measure.\" The meaning of the word Tatfif here is to be stingy with measurement and weight, either by increasing it if it is due from the others, or decreasing it if it is a debt. Thus, Allah explains that the Mutaffifin those whom He has promised loss and destruction, whom are meant by \"Woe\" - are</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ إِذَا اكْتَالُوا عَلَى النَّاسِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who, when they have to receive by measure from men,)</span> meaning, from among the people.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَسْتَوْفُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(demand full measure,)</span> meaning, they take their right by demanding full measure and extra as well.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا كَالُوهُمْ أَو وَّزَنُوهُمْ يُخْسِرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when they have to give by measure or weight to <span class=\"gray\">(other)</span> men, give less than due.)</span> meaning, they decrease. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Verily, Allah commanded that the measure and weight should be given in full. He says in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَوْفُوا الْكَيْلَ إِذَا كِلْتُمْ وَزِنُوا بِالْقِسْطَاسِ الْمُسْتَقِيمِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight. That is good and better in the end.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(17:35)</span> Allah also says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَوْفُوا الْكَيْلَ وَالْمِيزَانَ بِالْقِسْطِ ۖ لَا نُكَلِّفُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And give full measure and full weight with justice. We burden not any person, but with that which he can bear.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:152)</span> and He says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَقِيمُوا الْوَزْنَ بِالْقِسْطِ وَلَا تُخْسِرُوا الْمِيزَانَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And observe the weight with equity and do not make the balance deficient.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(55:9)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah destroyed the people of Shu'ayb and wiped them out because of their cheating in weights and measurements.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Threatening the Mutaffifin with standing before the Lord of all that exists</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah says as a threat to them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَا يَظُنُّ أُولَٰئِكَ أَنَّهُم مَّبْعُوثُونَ - لِيَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do they not think that they will be resurrected, on a Great Day?)</span> meaning, do these people not fear the resurrection and standing before He Who knows the hidden matters and the innermost secrets, on a Day that contains great horror and tremendous fright? Whoever loses on this Day will be made to enter into a blazing fire. Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَقُومُ النَّاسُ لِرَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Day when <span class=\"gray\">(all)</span> mankind will stand before the Lord of all that exists?)</span> meaning, they will stand barefooted, naked and uncircumcised at a station that will be difficult, hard, and distressful for the criminals. They will be covered by the command from Allah, and it will be that, which the strength and the senses will not be able to bare. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Malik reported from Nafi' who reported from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ يَقُومُ النَّاسُ لِرَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ، حَتّٰى يَغِيبَ أَحَدُهُمْ فِي رَشْحِهِ إِلَى أَنْصَافِ أُذُنَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(This will be the Day that mankind will stand before the Lord of all that exists, until one of them will sink up to the middle of his ears in sweat.)</span> Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith from Malik and 'Abdullah bin 'Awn, both of whom reported it from Nafi'. Muslim also recorded it from two routes.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Another Hadith:  Imam Ahmad recorded from Al-Miqdad, who was Ibn Al-Aswad Al-Kindi, that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا كَانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَامَةِ أُدْنِيَتِ الشَّمْسُ مِنَ الْعِبَادِ حَتّٰى تَكُونَ قَدْرَ مِيلٍ أَوْ مِيلَيْنِ - قال - فَتَصْهَرُهُمُ الشَّمْسُ فَيَكُونُونَ فِي الْعَرَقِ كَقَدْرِ أَعْمَالِهِمْ، مِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَأْخُذُهُ إِلَى عَقِبَيْهِ، وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَأْخُذُهُ إِلَى رُكْبَتَيْهِ، وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَأْخُذُهُ إِلَى حَقْوَيْهِ، وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يُلْجِمُهُ إِلْجَامًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On the Day of Judgement, the sun will draw near the servants until it is a mile or two away from them. Then the sun will burn them, and they will be submersed in sweat based upon the amount of their deeds. From among them there will be those whose sweat will come up to their two heels. From among them there will be those whose sweat will come up to their two knees. From among them there will be those whose sweat will come up to their groins. From among them there will be those who will be bridled in sweat <span class=\"gray\">(up to their necks)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Hadith was recorded by Muslim and At-Tirmidhi.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In Sunan Abu Dawud it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to seek refuge with Allah from the hardship of standing on the Day of Judgement. It has been reported from Ibn Mas'ud that they will be standing for forty years with their heads raised toward the sky. No one will speak to them, and the righteous and wicked among them will all be bridled in sweat. It has been reported from Ibn 'Umar that they will be standing for one hundred years. Both of these statements have been recorded by Ibn Jarir. In the Sunans of Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah, it is recorded from 'A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to begin his late night prayer by declaring Allah's greatness ten times, praising Allah ten times, glorifying Allah ten times, and seeking Allah's forgiveness ten times. Then he would say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللْهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي وَاهْدِنِي وَارْزُقْنِي وَعَافِنِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Allah! Forgive me, guide me, provide for me, and protect me.)</span> Then he would seek refuge from the hardship of the standing on the Day of Judgement.</p>"
