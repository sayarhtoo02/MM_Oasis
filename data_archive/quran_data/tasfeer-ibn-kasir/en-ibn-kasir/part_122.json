He tells us that everything that has a shadow leaning to the right and the left, i.e., in the morning and the evening, is by its shadow, prostrating to Allah. Mujahid said, \"When the sun passes its zenith, everything prostrates to Allah, may He be glorified.\" This was also said by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَهُمْ دَاخِرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(while they are humble)</span> means, they are in a state of humility. Mujahid also said: \"The prostration of every thing is its shadow\", and he mentioned the mountains and said that their prostrations are their shadows. Abu Ghalib Ash-Shaybani said: \"The waves of the sea are its prayers\". It is as if reason is attributed to these inanimate objects when they are described as prostrating, so Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلِلَّهِ يَسْجُدُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ مِن دَابَّةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And to Allah prostrate all that are in the heavens and all that are in the earth, of the moving creatures)</span> As Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلِلَّهِ يَسْجُدُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ طَوْعًا وَكَرْهًا وَظِلَالُهُم بِالْغُدُوِّ وَالْآصَالِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And to Allah <span class=\"gray\">(alone)</span> all who are in the heavens and the earth fall in prostration, willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the mornings and in the afternoons.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(13:15)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَهُمْ لَا يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and the angels, and they are not proud.)</span> means, they prostrate to Allah and are not too proud to worship Him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَخَافُونَ رَبَّهُم مِّن فَوْقِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They fear their Lord above them)</span> means, they prostrate out of fear of their Lord, may He be glorified.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and they do what they are commanded.)</span> meaning they continually obey Allah, doing what He tells them to do and avoiding that which He forbids.</p>"

The blessings include the benefits derived from their wool and hair, from which clothes and furnishings are made, from their milk which is drunk, and their young which are eaten. Their beauty is a kind of adornment, thus Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا جَمَالٌ حِينَ تُرِيحُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And there is beauty in them for you, when you bring them home in the evening.)</span> which is when they are brought back from the pasture in the evening.

They use these animals for all kinds of purposes, for riding and for carrying loads, as Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ فِي الْأَنْعَامِ لَعِبْرَةً ۖ نُّسْقِيكُم مِّمَّا فِي بُطُونِهَا وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَنَافِعُ كَثِيرَةٌ وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ - وَعَلَيْهَا وَعَلَى الْفُلْكِ تُحْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, there is indeed a lesson for you in the An'am <span class=\"gray\">(cattle)</span>.

According to the opinion of Mujahid, it is by way of instruction, i.e., it is saying: You had better fear associating partners in worship with Me, and be sincere in your obedience to Me. As Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَا لِلَّهِ الدِّينُ الْخَالِصُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely, the pure religion <span class=\"gray\">(sincere devotion)</span> is for Allah only.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(39:3)</span> Then Allah tells us that He is the One Who has the power to benefit and harm, and that the provisions, blessings, good health and help, His servants enjoy are from His bounty and graciousness towards them.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثُمَّ إِذَا مَسَّكُمُ الضُّرُّ فَإِلَيْهِ تَجْأَرُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then, when harm touches you, to Him you cry aloud for help.)</span> meaning because you know that none has the power to remove that harm except for Him, so when you are harmed, you turn to ask Him for help and beg Him for aid.
