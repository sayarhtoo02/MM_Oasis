Truly, when it was said to them: \"La ilaha illallah,\" they puffed themselves up with pride.)</span> means, in this world they were too arrogant to say these words as the believers said them. Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أُقَاتِلَ النَّاسَ حَتّٰى يَقُولُوا: لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، فَمَنْ قَالَ: لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، فَقَدْ عَصَمَ مِنِّي مَالَهُ وَنَفْسَهُ إِلَّا بِحَقِّهِ، وَحِسَابُهُ عَلَى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I have been commanded to fight the people until they say La ilaha ill-Allah. Whoever says La ilaha illallah, he and his property are safe from me except for his obligation, and his reckoning will be with Allah, may He be glorified.)</span> Allah revealed in His Book the story of people who were arrogant, as He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا إِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ - وَيَقُولُونَ أَئِنَّا لَتَارِكُو آلِهَتِنَا لِشَاعِرٍ مَجْنُونٍ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Truly, when it was said to them: \"La ilaha illallah,\" they puffed themselves up with pride. And <span class=\"gray\">(they)</span> said: \"Are we going to abandon our gods for the sake of a mad poet?\")</span> meaning, 'Shall we stop worshipping our gods and the gods of our forefathers just because of the words of this mad poet?' – meaning the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Allah said in refutation of their attitude:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَلْ جَاءَ بِالْحَقِّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Nay! he has come with the truth)</span> meaning, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has brought the truth with all that Allah has revealed to him of stories and commandments.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَصَدَّقَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and he confirms the Messengers.)</span> means, he fulfills their prophecies of his praiseworthy characteristics and his perfect way, and he tells people of the Laws and commands of Allah, as they said he would.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا يُقَالُ لَكَ إِلَّا مَا قَدْ قِيلَ لِلرُّسُلِ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Nothing is said to you except what was said to the Messengers before you)</span><span class=\"gray\">(41:43)</span>.</p>"
