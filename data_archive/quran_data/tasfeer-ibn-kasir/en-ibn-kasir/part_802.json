    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He created man from sounding clay like the clay of pottery <span>(14)</span>And the Jinn He created from a smokeless flame of fire <span>(15)</span>Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny <span>(16)</span>The Lord of the two easts and the Lord of the two wests <span>(17)</span>Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny <span>(18)</span>He has Maraja the two seas meeting together <span>(19)</span>Between them is a barrier which none of them can transgress <span>(20)</span>Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny <span>(21)</span>Out of them both come out pearls and Al-Marjan <span>(22)</span>Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny <span>(23)</span>And His are Al-Jawar Al-Munsha'at, in the seas like A'lam <span>(24)</span>Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny <span>(25)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Creation of Humans and Jinns</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah mentions that He created mankind from clay, like that used in pottery, and created the Jinns from the tip of the flame of a smokeless fire. This was said by Ad-Dahhak from Ibn 'Abbas. It was also said by 'Ikrimah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and Ibn Zayd. Al-'Awfi reported from Ibn 'Abbas, \"From the best part of the fire, from its smokeless flame.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that 'A'ishah said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خُلِقَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ مِنْ نُورٍ، وَخُلِقَ الْجَانُّ مِنْ مَارِجٍ مِنْ نَارٍ، وَخُلِقَ آدَمُ مِمَّا وُصِفَ لَكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The angels were created from light, the Jinns from a smokeless flame of fire, and 'Adam from what was described to you.)</span> Muslim also collected this Hadith. Allah's statement:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny)</span> was explained above.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah is the Lord of the Two Easts and the Two Wests</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبُّ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ وَرَبُّ الْمَغْرِبَيْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(He is)</span> the Lord of the two easts and the Lord of the two wests.)</span> meaning the sunrise of summer and winter and the sunset of summer and winter. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا أُقْسِمُ بِرَبِّ الْمَشَارِقِ وَالْمَغَارِبِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So, I swear by the Lord of all the points of sunrise and sunset in the east and the west.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(70:40)</span>, referring to the different places from which the sun rises and then sets on people every day. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبُّ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ فَاتَّخِذْهُ وَكِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Lord of the east and the west; none has the right to be worshipped but He. So take Him alone as a trustee.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(73:9)</span>, referring to the different places of sunrise and sunset and the benefits that this variation brings to the created, mankind and Jinns,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah created Different Types of Water</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ يَلْتَقِيَانِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He has Maraja the two seas)</span>, or let them loose, according to Ibn 'Abbas. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">يَلْتَقِيَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(meeting together.)</span> Ibn Zayd said, \"He prevents them from meeting by the dividing barrier He placed between them to separate them.\" The two seas are the fresh and salty waters, the former coming from running rivers. We discussed this topic in Surat Al-Furqan when explaining Allah's statement;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَهُوَ الَّذِي مَرَجَ الْبَحْرَيْنِ هَٰذَا عَذْبٌ فُرَاتٌ وَهَٰذَا مِلْحٌ أُجَاجٌ وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخًا وَحِجْرًا مَحْجُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And it is He Who has let free the two seas: one palatable and sweet, and the other salty and bitter; and He has set a barrier and a complete partition between them.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(25:53)</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَيْنَهُمَا بَرْزَخٌ لَا يَبْغِيَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Between them is a barrier which none of them can transgress.)</span> meaning, He has placed a barrier of land between these two types of waters, so that they do not transgress upon each other, which would spoil the characteristics they were created with. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَخْرُجُ مِنْهُمَا اللُّؤْلُؤُ وَالْمَرْجَانُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Out of them both come out pearls and Al-Marjan.)</span> pearls are well-known. As for Marjan they say it means small pearls. Mujahid, Qatadah, Abu Ruzayn, Ad-Dahhak said it, and it has also been reported from 'Ali. It was also said that it means large, precious pearls, this was mentioned by Ibn Jarir from some of the Salaf. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Ibn 'Abbas who said, \"When it rains, the oysters in the sea open their mouths. What falls in them, the drops, turns into pearls.\" Its chain of narrators is Sahih. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Since this type of adornment is a favor from Allah to the people of earth, He reminded them of it,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny?)</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَهُ الْجَوَارِ الْمُنْشَآتُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And His are Al-Jawar Al-Munsha'at)</span>, meaning the ships that float,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِي الْبَحْرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(in the seas)</span>, Mujahid said, \"Whatever ship hoists a sail, it is from Munsha'at, if it does not hoist a sail, it is not from the Munsha'at.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Qatadah said, \"Al-Munsha'at means created.\" Others said that it is Al-Munshi'at meaning, \"launched.\"</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">كَالْأَعْلَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(like A'lam.)</span> This means, they are like mountains with their great size, and it also refers to the trade and commercial services they make possible, transporting cargo from one area to another and from one province to another. Ships provide various benefits for people, including transporting different types of goods they need. Therefore,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny?)</span></p>"

O You Who created the heavens and the earth without precedence. O You, Who Owns the glory and the honor, none has the right to be worshipped except You. We seek refuge with Your mercy. Grant Us success in all of our matters. Please, do not abandon us to rely on ourselves even for an instant nor on any of Your creation.\" Ash-Sha'bi said, \"When you have recited,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whatsoever is on it <span class=\"gray\">(the earth)</span> will perish.)</span> do not stop, continue reading,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَبْقَىٰ وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And the Face of your Lord Dhul-Jalal wal-Ikram will remain forever.)</span>\" This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كُلُّ شَيْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلَّا وَجْهَهُ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Everything will perish save His Face.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(28:88)</span> In this Ayah, Allah describes His Noble Face as being Dhul-Jalal wal-Ikram, indicating that He is Worthy of being revered, and thus, never defied; and obeyed, and thus, never disobeyed,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاصْبِرْ نَفْسَكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ بِالْغَدَاةِ وَالْعَشِيِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And keep yourself patiently with those who call on their Lord morning and afternoon, seeking His Face.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(18:28)</span>, And as He said about those giving charity:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّمَا نُطْعِمُكُمْ لِوَجْهِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We feed you seeking Allah's Face only.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(76:9)</span> Ibn 'Abbas commented on the meaning of Dhul-Jalal wal-Ikram, by saying, \"Owner of greatness and pride.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">After Allah stated that all of the inhabitants of the earth will die and end up in the Hereafter when He, Dhul-Jalal wal-Ikram, will judge them by His fair judgement, He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then which of the blessings of your Lord will you both deny?)</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَسْأَلُهُ مَنْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ هُوَ فِي شَأْنٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whosoever is in the heavens and on the earth begs of Him.
