That is the Lord of all that exists. <span>(9)</span>He placed therein firm mountains from above it, and He blessed it, and measured therein its sustenance in four Days equal for all those who ask <span>(10)</span>Then He rose over <span class=\"gray\">(Istawa ila)</span> the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: \"Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.\" They both said: \"We come willingly. <span>(11)</span>Then He completed and finished their creation <span class=\"gray\">(as)</span> seven heavens in two Days and He made in each heaven its affair. And We adorned the nearest <span class=\"gray\">(lowest)</span> heaven with lamps <span class=\"gray\">(stars)</span> to be an adornment as well as to guard. Such is the decree of Him, the Almighty, the All-Knower <span>(12)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Some Details of the Creation of this Universe </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Here Allah denounces the idolators who worship other gods apart from Him although He is the Creator, Subduer and Controller of all things. He says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ أَئِنَّكُمْ لَتَكْفُرُونَ بِالَّذِي خَلَقَ الْأَرْضَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ وَتَجْعَلُونَ لَهُ أَنْدَادًا ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days? And you set up rivals with Him?\")</span> meaning, 'false gods whom you worship alongside Him?'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ذَٰلِكَ رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That is the Lord of the that exists.)</span> the Creator of all things is the Lord of all the creatures. Here the Ayah;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7:54)</span>. is explained in more detail; the creation of the earth and the creation of the heaven are discussed separately. Allah says that He created the earth first, because it is the foundation, and the foundation should be built first, then the roof. Allah says elsewhere:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ لَكُمْ مَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ فَسَوَّاهُنَّ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He it is Who created for you all that is on the earth. Then He rose over <span class=\"gray\">(Istawa ila)</span> the heaven and made them seven heavens)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:29)</span>. With regard to the Ayat:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَأَنْتُمْ أَشَدُّ خَلْقًا أَمِ السَّمَاءُ ۚ بَنَاهَا - رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا - وَأَغْطَشَ لَيْلَهَا وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَاهَا - وَالْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ دَحَاهَا - أَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَاءَهَا وَمَرْعَاهَا - وَالْجِبَالَ أَرْسَاهَا - مَتَاعًا لَكُمْ وَلِأَنْعَامِكُمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed? He raised its height, and has perfected it. Its night He covers with darkness and its forenoon He brings out <span class=\"gray\">(with light)</span>. And after that He spread the earth, And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. And the mountains He has fixed firmly, <span class=\"gray\">(to be)</span> a provision and benefit for you and your cattle.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(79:27-33)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Ayah states that the spreading out of the earth came after the creation of the heavens, but the earth itself was created before the heavens according to some texts. This was the response of Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, as recorded by Al-Bukhari in his Tafsir of this Ayah in his Sahih. He recorded that Sa'id bin Jubayr said: \"A man said to Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, saying: 'I find some things in the Qur'an which confuse me:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا أَنْسَابَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلَا يَتَسَاءَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another)</span><span class=\"gray\">(23:101)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ يَتَسَاءَلُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they will turn to one another and question one another)</span><span class=\"gray\">(37:27)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:42)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:23)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">But in this Ayah they did hide something. And Allah says:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">أَأَنْتُمْ أَشَدُّ خَلْقًا أَمِ السَّمَاءُ ۚ بَنَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed?)</span> until;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ دَحَاهَا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And after that He spread the earth.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(79:27-30)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So He mentioned the creation of the heavens before the earth, then He said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">قُلْ أَئِنَّكُمْ لَتَكْفُرُونَ بِالَّذِي خَلَقَ الْأَرْضَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say: \"Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days?...\")</span> until;</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">طَائِعِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We come willingly.)</span> Here He mentioned the creation of the earth before the creation of the heavens. And He says:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَ كَانَ غَفُورًا رَحِيمًا </p><p lang=\"ga\" class=\"ga \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allāh <span class=\"gray\">(Kāna)</span> is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:96)</span></p><p class=\"fi qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fi\">عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Most Powerful, All-Wise)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:56)</span>.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">سَمِيعًا بَصِيرًا </p><p lang=\"fy\" class=\"fy \"><span class=\"gray\">(All-Hearer, All-Seer)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:58)</span>. It is as if He was and is no longer.' </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, replied:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا أَنْسَابَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلَا يَتَسَاءَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another)</span><span class=\"gray\">(23:101)</span>, this will happen when the Trumpet is blown for the first time.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَصَعِقَ مَنْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا مَنْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away, except him whom Allah wills)</span><span class=\"gray\">(39:68)</span>, and at that time there will be no kinship among them, nor will they ask of one another. Then when the Sur will be blown again,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ يَتَسَاءَلُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they will turn to one another and question one another)</span><span class=\"gray\">(37:27)</span>. With regard to the Ayat,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:23)</span> and</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا يَكْتُمُونَ اللَّهَ حَدِيثًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:42)</span>, Allah will forgive the sincere believers their sins, then the idolators will say, 'Let us say that we never joined others in worship with Allah.' Then a seal will be placed over their mouths, and their hands will speak. Then it will be known that not a single fact can be hidden from Allah, and at that point,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوَدُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(those who disbelieved will wish)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:42)</span>. Allah created the earth in two days, then He created the heavens, then He <span class=\"gray\">(Istawa ila)</span> the heaven and gave it its shape in two more days. Then He spread the earth, which means that He brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. And He created the mountains, sands, inanimate things, rocks and hills and everything in between, in two more days. This is what Allah says:</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\"> دَحَاهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(He)</span> spread <span class=\"gray\">(the earth)</span>)</span><span class=\"gray\">(79:30)</span> And Allah's saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خَلَقَ الْأَرْضَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(He)</span> created the earth in two Days)</span> So He created the earth and everything in it in four days, and He created the heavens in two days.</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">وَ كَانَ غَفُورًا رَحِيمًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allāh <span class=\"gray\">(Kāna)</span> is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:96)</span>. This is how He described Himself, and this is how He still is. Whatever Allah wills comes to pass, so do not be confused about the Qur'an, for all of it comes from Allah.'\" This was recorded by Al-Bukhari.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خَلَقَ الْأَرْضَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(He)</span> created the earth in two Days)</span> means, on Sunday and Monday.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَعَلَ فِيهَا رَوَاسِيَ مِنْ فَوْقِهَا وَبَارَكَ فِيهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He placed therein firm mountains from above it, and He blessed it,)</span> means, He blessed it and gave it the potential to be planted with seeds and bring forth produce.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَدَّرَ فِيهَا أَقْوَاتَهَا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And measured therein its sustenance)</span> means, what its people need of provision and places in which to plant things and grow crops. This was on Tuesday and Wednesday, which together with the two previous days add up to four days.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِي أَرْبَعَةِ أَيَّامٍ سَوَاءً لِلسَّائِلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(in four Days equal for all those who ask.)</span> meaning, for those who want to ask about that, so that they might know. 'Ikrimah and Mujahid said concerning the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَدَّرَ فِيهَا أَقْوَاتَهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and measured therein its sustenance)</span>: \"He placed in every land that which is not suited for any other land.\" Ibn 'Abbas, Qatadah and As-Suddi said, concerning the Ayah,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">سَوَاءً لِلسَّائِلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(equal for all those who ask)</span>: this means, \"For whoever wants to ask about that.\" Ibn Zayd said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَدَّرَ فِيهَا أَقْوَاتَهَا فِي أَرْبَعَةِ أَيَّامٍ سَوَاءً لِلسَّائِلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and measured therein its sustenance in four Days equal for all those who ask.)</span> \"According to whatever a person who is need of provision wants, Allah measures out for him what he needs.\" This is like what they said concerning the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَآتَاكُمْ مِنْ كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And He gave you of all that you asked for)</span><span class=\"gray\">(14:34)</span>.
