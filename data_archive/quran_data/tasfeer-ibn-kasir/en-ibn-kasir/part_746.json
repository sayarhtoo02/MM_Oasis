The Messenger of Allah ﷺ smiled and did not say anything.\" This is the narration reported by Abu Dawud.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Marduwyah mentioned this honorable Ayah and then reported that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ قَتَلَ نَفْسَهُ بـحَدِيدَةٍ، فَحَدِيدَتُهُ فِي يَدِهِ، يَجَأُ بِهَا بطْنَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ، خَالِدًا مُخَلَّدًا فِيهَا أَبَدًا، ومَنْ قَتَلَ نَفْسَهُ بِسُمٍّ فَسُمُّهُ فِي يَدِهِ، يَتَحَسَّاهُ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ، خَالِدًا مُخَلَّدًا فِيهَا أَبَدًا، وَمَنْ تَرَدَّى مِنْ جَبَلٍ فَقَتلَ نَفْسَهُ، فَهُوَ مُتَرَدٍّ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ، خَالِدًا مُخَلَّدًا فِيهَا أَبَدًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever kills himself with an iron tool, then his tool will be in his hand and he will keep stabbing himself with it in the Fire of Jahannam, forever and ever.

Whoever kills himself by throwing himself from a mountain, will keep falling in the Fire of Jahannam forever and ever.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Hadith was also collected in the Two Sahihs. Abu Qilabah said that Thabit bin Ad-Dahhak said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ قَتَلَ نَفْسَهُ بِشَيْءٍ، عُذِّبَ بِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever kills himself with an instrument, will be punished with it on the Day of Resurrection.)</span> This Hadith was collected by the Group.

Imam Ahmad recorded that Salman Al-Farisi said, \"The Prophet ﷺ said to me, 'Do you know what the day of Al-Jumu'ah is?' I said, 'It is the day during which Allah brought together the creation of your father <span class=\"gray\">(Adam)</span>.'

Anyone who takes a bath and cleans himself as much as he can and then proceeds for the Friday prayer and remains quiet until the Imam finishes the prayer, all his sins in between the present and the next Friday will be forgiven, as long as major sins were avoided.)</span>\" Al-Bukhari recorded similar wording from Salman Al-Farisi.</p><div lang=\"fr\" class=\"fr \"><h2>The Seven Destructive Sins</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">What are the Seven Destructive Sins?
