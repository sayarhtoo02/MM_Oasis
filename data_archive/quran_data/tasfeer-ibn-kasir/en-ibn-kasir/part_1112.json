However, they did not fulfill their vows or say the truth with their words. The consequence of this action is that hypocrisy was placed in their hearts until the Day they meet Allah the Exalted, on the Day of Resurrection. We seek refuge with Allah from such an end. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِمَا أَخْلَفُوا اللَّهَ مَا وَعَدُوهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...because they broke that <span class=\"gray\">(covenant)</span> with Allah which they had promised to Him)</span> He placed hypocrisy in their hearts because they broke their promise and lied. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">آيَةُ الْمُنَافِقِ ثَلَاثٌ: إِذَا حَدَّثَ كَذَبَ، وَإِذَا وَعَدَ أَخْلَفَ، وَإِذَا ائْتُمِنَ خَانَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There are three signs for a hypocrite: if he speaks, he lies; if he promises, he breaks the promise; and if he is entrusted, he betrays the trust.)</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ سِرَّهُمْ وَنَجْوَاهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Know they not that Allah knows their secret ideas, and their Najwa,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah states that He knows the secret and what is more hidden than the secret. He has full knowledge of what is in their hearts, even when they pretend that they will give away alms, if they acquire wealth, and will be grateful to Allah for it. Truly, Allah knows them better than they know themselves, for He is the All-Knower of all unseen and apparent things, every secret, every session of counsel, and all that is seen and hidden.</p>"

If, for instance, someone gives away a large amount, the hypocrites say that he is showing off. If someone gives away a small amount they say that Allah stands not in need of this man's charity. Al-Bukhari recorded that 'Ubaydullah bin Sa'id said that Abu An-Nu'man Al-Basri said that Shu'bah narrated that Sulayman said that Abu Wa'il said that Abu Mas'ud said, \"When the verses of charity were revealed, we used to work as porters. A man came and distributed objects of charity in abundance and they <span class=\"gray\">(hypocrites)</span> said, 'He is showing off.' Another man came and gave a Sa' <span class=\"gray\">(a small measure of food grains)</span>; they said, 'Allah is not in need of this small amount of charity.'

Among the last to come forth was a man who brought a Sa' of dates, saying, 'O Allah's Messenger! This is a Sa' of dates. I spent the night bringing water and earned two Sa' of dates for my work. I kept one Sa' and brought you the other Sa'. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered him to add it to the charity. Some men mocked that man, saying, 'Allah and His Messenger are not in need of this charity. What benefit would this Sa' of yours bring?' 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf asked Allah's Messenger ﷺ, 'Are there any more people who give charity?' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَمْ يَبْقَ أَحَدٌ غَيْرُكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(None besides you!)</span> 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf said, 'I will give a hundred Uqiyah of gold as a charity.' 'Umar bin Al-Khattab said to him, 'Are you crazy?' 'Abdur-Rahman said, 'I am not crazy.' 'Umar said, 'Have you given what you said would give?' 'Abdur-Rahman said, 'Yes. I have eight thousand <span class=\"gray\">(Dirhams)</span>, four thousand I give as a loan to my Lord and four thousand I keep for myself.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَارَكَ اللهُ لَكَ فِيمَا أَمْسَكْتَ وَفِيمَا أَعْطَيْتَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(May Allah bless you for what you kept and what you gave away)</span>. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">However, the hypocrites defamed him, 'By Allah! 'Abdur-Rahman gave what he gave just to show off.' They lied, for 'Abdur-Rahman willingly gave that money, and Allah revealed about his innocence and the innocence of the fellow who was poor and brought only a Sa' of dates. Allah said in His Book,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الَّذِينَ يَلْمِزُونَ الْمُطَّوِّعِينَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ فِي الصَّدَقَاتِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Those who defame such of the believers who give charity voluntarily)</span><span class=\"gray\">[9:79]</span>.'\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">A similar story was narrated from Mujahid and several others. Ibn Ishaq said, \"Among the believers who gave away charity were 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf who gave four thousand Dirhams and 'Asim bin 'Adi from Bani 'Ajlan. This occurred after the Messenger of Allah ﷺ encouraged and called for paying charity. 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf stood and gave away four thousand Dirhams. 'Asim bin 'Adi also stood and gave a hundred Wasaq of dates, but some people defamed them, saying, 'They are showing off.' As for the person who gave the little that he could afford, he was Abu 'Aqil, from Bani Anif Al-Arashi, who was an ally of Bani 'Amr bin 'Awf. He brought a Sa' of dates and added it to the charity. They laughed at him, saying, 'Allah does not need the Sa' of Abu 'Aqil.'\" </p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَيَسْخَرُونَ مِنْهُمْ ۙ سَخِرَ اللَّهُ مِنْهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so they mock at them <span class=\"gray\">(believers)</span>; Allah will throw back their mockery on them)</span> rebuking them for their evil actions and defaming the believers. Truly, the reward, or punishment, is equitable to the action. Allah treated them the way mocked people are treated, to aid the believers in this life. Allah has prepared a painful torment in the Hereafter for the hypocrites, for the recompense is similar to the deed.</p>"
