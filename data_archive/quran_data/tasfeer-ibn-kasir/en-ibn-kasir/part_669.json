    "text": "<p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"> In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حم - وَالْكِتَابِ الْمُبِينِ - إِنَّا جَعَلْنَاهُ قُرْآنًا عَرَبِيًّا لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ - وَإِنَّهُ فِي أُمِّ الْكِتَابِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِيٌّ حَكِيمٌ - أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنْكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحًا أَنْ كُنْتُمْ قَوْمًا مُسْرِفِينَ - وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِنْ نَبِيٍّ فِي الْأَوَّلِينَ - وَمَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِنْ نَبِيٍّ إِلَّا كَانُوا بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ - فَأَهْلَكْنَا أَشَدَّ مِنْهُمْ بَطْشًا وَمَضَىٰ مَثَلُ الْأَوَّلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(1. Ha Mim.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2. By the manifest Book.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(3. Verily, We have made it a Qur'an in Arabic that you may be able to understand.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4. And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(5. Shall We then take away the Reminder from you, because you are a people excessive.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6. And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(7. And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(8. Then We destroyed men stronger <span class=\"gray\">(in power)</span> than these and the example of the ancients has passed away.)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حم - وَالْكِتَابِ الْمُبِينِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Ha-Mim. By the manifest Book.)</span> means, plain and clear in both wording and meaning, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs, which is the most eloquent language for communication among people. Allah says:</p><p class=\"ur qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ur\">إِنَّا جَعَلْنَاهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, We have made it)</span> meaning, revealed it,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">قُرْآنًا عَرَبِيًّا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(a Qur'an in Arabic)</span> meaning, in the language of the Arabs, eloquent and clear;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(that you may be able to understand.)</span> means, that you may understand it and ponder its meanings. This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِيٍّ مُبِينٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In the plain Arabic language.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(26:195)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّهُ فِي أُمِّ الْكِتَابِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِيٌّ حَكِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.)</span> This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high <span class=\"gray\">(the angels)</span>, so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَإِنَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, it)</span> means, the Qur'an,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فِي أُمِّ الْكِتَابِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(is in the Mother of the Book)</span> meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz <span class=\"gray\">(the Preserved Tablet)</span>. This was the view of Ibn 'Abbas and Mujahid.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَدَيْنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(with Us,)</span> means, in Our presence. This was the view of Qatadah and others.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">لَعَلِيٌّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(indeed exalted)</span> means, occupying a position of honor and virtue. This was the view of Qatadah.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">حَكِيمٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(full of wisdom.)</span> means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّهُ لَقُرْآنٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِي كِتَابٍ مَكْنُونٍ - لَا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنْزِيلٌ مِنْ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That <span class=\"gray\">(this)</span> is indeed an honorable recitation. In a Book well-guarded. Which none can touch but the pure. A revelation from the Lord of the all that exists.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(56:77-80)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَلَّا إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ - فَمَنْ شَاءَ ذَكَرَهُ - فِي صُحُفٍ مُكَرَّمَةٍ - مَرْفُوعَةٍ مُطَهَّرَةٍ - بِأَيْدِي سَفَرَةٍ - كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Nay, indeed it is an admonition. So whoever wills, let him pay attention to it. <span class=\"gray\">(It is)</span> in Records held <span class=\"gray\">(greatly)</span> in honor, exalted, purified, in the hands of scribes <span class=\"gray\">(angels)</span>, honorable and obedient.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(80:11-16)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنْكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحًا أَنْ كُنْتُمْ قَوْمًا مُسْرِفِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Shall We then take away the Reminder <span class=\"gray\">(this Qur'an)</span> from you, because you are a people excessive.)</span> means, 'do you think that We will forgive you and not punish you, when you do not do as you have been commanded?' This was the view of Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Abu Salih, Mujahid and As-Suddi, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنْكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Shall We then take away the Reminder <span class=\"gray\">(this Qur'an)</span> from you,)</span> Qatadah said, \"By Allah, if this Qur'an had been taken away when the first generations of this Ummah rejected it, they would have been doomed, but Allah by His mercy persisted in sending it and calling them to it for twenty years, or for as long as He willed.\" What Qatadah said is very good, and his point is that Allah, by His grace and mercy towards His creation, did not stop calling them to the truth and to the wise Reminder, i.e., the Qur'an, even though they were heedless and turned away from it. Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Consolation to the Prophet ﷺ for the Disbelief of Quraysh</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Then Allah consoles His Prophet ﷺ for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِنْ نَبِيٍّ فِي الْأَوَّلِينَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.)</span> meaning, among the sects <span class=\"gray\">(communities)</span> of old.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا يَأْتِيهِمْ مِنْ نَبِيٍّ إِلَّا كَانُوا بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِئُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.)</span> means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَهْلَكْنَا أَشَدَّ مِنْهُمْ بَطْشًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then We destroyed men stronger than these)</span> means, 'We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ فَيَنْظُرُوا كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ ۚ كَانُوا أَكْثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them? They were more in number than them and mightier in strength)</span><span class=\"gray\">(40:82)</span>. And there are many similar Ayat.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَضَىٰ مَثَلُ الْأَوَّلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and the example of the ancients has passed away.)</span> Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., 'We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَجَعَلْنَاهُمْ سَلَفًا وَمَثَلًا لِلْآخِرِينَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(43:56)</span>;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">سُنَّتَ اللَّهِ الَّتِي قَدْ خَلَتْ فِي عِبَادِهِ ۖ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants)</span><span class=\"gray\">(40:85)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَنْ تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلًا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(33:62)</span></p>"
