Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">تَجْرِي بِأَعْيُنِنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Floating under Our Eyes)</span>, means, 'by Our command and under Our protection and observation,'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">جَزَاءً لِمَنْ كَانَ كُفِرَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(a reward for him who had been rejected!)</span> meaning, as recompense for them because of their disbelief in Allah and as reward for Nuh, peace be upon him.

How was My help that I extended to My Messengers and the revenge exerted on their behalf,'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا الْقُرْآنَ لِلذِّكْرِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember)</span>; meaning, 'We have made the Qur'an easy to recite and comprehend for those who seek these traits, to remind mankind,' as Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كِتَابٌ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِيَدَّبَّرُوا آيَاتِهِ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(<span class=\"gray\">(This is)</span> a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Ayat, and that men of understanding may remember.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(38:29)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِنَّمَا يَسَّرْنَاهُ بِلِسَانِكَ لِتُبَشِّرَ بِهِ الْمُتَّقِينَ وَتُنْذِرَ بِهِ قَوْمًا لُدًّا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So We have made this <span class=\"gray\">(the Qur'an)</span> easy in your own tongue, only that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa and warn with it the most quarrelsome people.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(19:97)</span> Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَهَلْ مِنْ مُدَّكِرٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(then is there any that will remember)</span>, meaning, 'is there anyone who will remember through this Qur'an, which We made easy to memorize and easy to understand?' Muhammad bin Ka'b Al-Qurazi commented on this Ayah, \"Is there anyone who will avoid evil?\"</p>"
