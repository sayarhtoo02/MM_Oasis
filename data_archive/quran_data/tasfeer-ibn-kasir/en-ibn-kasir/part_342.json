Sa'id bin Jubayr said, \"This was revealed concerning seventy priests who were sent by An-Najashi <span class=\"gray\">(ruler of Ethiopia)</span>.

Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بِمَا صَبَرُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(because they are patient,)</span> meaning, in their adherence to the truth, for taking such thing upon oneself is not easy for people. It was reported in the Sahih from the Hadith of 'Amir Ash-Sha'bi from Abu Burdah that Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثَلَاثَةٌ يُؤْتَوْنَ أَجْرَهُمْ مَرَّتَيْنِ: رَجُلٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ آمَنَ بِنَبِيِّهِ ثُمَّ آمَنَ بِي، وَعَبْدٌ مَمْلُوكٌ أَدَّى حَقَّ اللهِ وَحَقَّ مَوَالِيهِ،وَرَجُلٌ كَانَتْ لَهُ أَمَةٌ، فَأَدَّبَهَا فَأَحْسَنَ تَأْدِيبَهَا، ثُمَّ أَعْتَقَهَا فَتَزَوَّجَهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There are three who will be given their reward twice: a man among the People of the Book who believed in his Prophet then believed in me; a slave who fulfills his duty towards Allah and towards his master; and a man who has a slave woman and educates her and teaches her good manners, then he frees her and marries her.)</span> Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Umamah said: \"On the day of the Conquest <span class=\"gray\">[of Makkah]</span> I was walking alongside the Messenger of Allah ﷺ as he was riding, and he said some very beautiful words, including the following:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ أَسْلَمَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابَيْنِ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ مَرَّتَيْنِ وَلَهُ مَا لَنَا وَعَلَيْهِ مَا عَلَيْنَا وَمَنْ أَسْلَمَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ وَلَهُ مَا لَنَا وَعَلَيْهِ مَا عَلَيْنَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Whoever among the people of the two Books becomes Muslim, he will have his reward twice, and he has the same rights and duties as we do. Whoever among the idolators becomes Muslim will have one reward, and he has the same rights and duties as we do.)</span>\" Allah's saying:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَدْرَءُونَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ السَّيِّئَةَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and repel evil with good,)</span> means, they do not respond to evil in kind, rather they forgive and overlook.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنْفِقُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and spend out of what We have provided for them.)</span> meaning, 'from the lawful provision that We have given them, they spend on their families and relatives as they are required to do, and they pay Zakah and give voluntary charity.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا سَمِعُوا اللَّغْوَ أَعْرَضُوا عَنْهُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And when they hear evil vain talk, they withdraw from it)</span> meaning, they do not mix with the people who indulge in such talk, rather they do as Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا مَرُّوا بِاللَّغْوِ مَرُّوا كِرَامًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and if they pass by some evil vain talk, they pass by it with dignity)</span><span class=\"gray\">(25:72)</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالُوا لَنَا أَعْمَالُنَا وَلَكُمْ أَعْمَالُكُمْ سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ لَا نَبْتَغِي الْجَاهِلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and they say: \"To us our deeds, and to you your deeds. Peace be to you. We seek not <span class=\"gray\">(the way of)</span> the ignorant.\")</span> means, if some foolish person speaks to them in a foolish manner and says something to which it does not befit them to respond, they turn away from him and do not respond in kind with ugly speech. They never say anything but good words. Allah says of them that they say:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> لَنَا أَعْمَالُنَا وَلَكُمْ أَعْمَالُكُمْ سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ لَا نَبْتَغِي الْجَاهِلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(To us our deeds, and to you your deeds. Peace be to you. We seek not <span class=\"gray\">(the way of)</span> the ignorant.)</span> meaning, 'we do not seek the way of the ignorant and we do not like it.'</p>"
