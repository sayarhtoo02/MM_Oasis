This Ayah is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from among yourselves.

Had this been the Prophet's behavior, \"They would have scattered from around you.

For instance, before the battle of Badr, the Prophet ﷺ asked his Companions for if Muslims should intercept the caravan <span class=\"gray\">(led by Abu Sufyan)</span>. They said, \"O Messenger of Allah! If you wish to cross the sea, we would follow you in it, and if you march forth to Barkul-Ghimad we would march with you. We would never say what the Children of Israel said to Musa, 'So go, you and your Lord, and fight you two, we are sitting right here.' Rather, we say march forth and we shall march forth with you; and before you, and to your right and left shall we fight.\" The Prophet ﷺ also asked them for their opinion about where they should set up camp at Badr. Al-Mundhir bin 'Amr suggested to camp close to the enemy, for he wished to acquire martyrdom.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Concerning the battle of Uhud, the Messenger ﷺ asked the Companions if they should fortify themselves in Al-Madinah or go out to meet the enemy, and the majority of them requested that they go out to meet the enemy, and he did. He also took their advice on the day of Khandaq <span class=\"gray\">(the Trench)</span> about conducting a peace treaty with some of the tribes of Al-Ahzab <span class=\"gray\">(the Confederates)</span>, in return for giving them one-third of the fruits of Al-Madinah. However, Sa'd bin 'Ubadah and Sa'd bin Mu'adh rejected this offer and the Prophet ﷺ went ahead with their advice. The Prophet ﷺ also asked them if they should attack the idolators on the Day of Hudaybiyyah, and Abu Bakr disagreed, saying, \"We did not come here to fight anyone. Rather, we came to perform 'Umrah.\" The Prophet ﷺ agreed.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">On the day of Ifk, <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. the false accusation)</span>, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to them, \"O Muslims! Give me your advice about some men who falsely accused my wife <span class=\"gray\">('A'ishah)</span>. By Allah! I never knew of any evil to come from my wife. And they accused whom? They accused he from whom I only knew righteous conduct, by Allah!\" The Prophet ﷺ asked 'Ali and Usamah about divorcing 'A'ishah. In summary, the Prophet ﷺ used to take his Companions' advice for battles and other important events.</p><p lang=\"jv\" class=\"jv \">Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet ﷺ said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">الْمُسْتَشَارُ مُؤْتَمَنٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The one whom advice is sought from is to be entrusted)</span> This was recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i who graded it Hasan.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Trust in Allah After Taking the Decision</h2></div><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَإِذَا عَزَمْتَ فَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allah,)</span> means, if you conduct the required consultation and you then make a decision, trust in Allah over your decision,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُتَوَكِّلِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(certainly, Allah loves those who put their trust <span class=\"gray\">(in Him)</span>)</span>.</p><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِن يَنصُرْكُمُ اللَّهُ فَلَا غَالِبَ لَكُمْ وَإِن يَخْذُلْكُمْ فَمَن ذَا الَّذِي يَنصُرُكُم مِّن بَعْدِهِ وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If Allah helps you, none can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, who is there after Him that can help you?

Some people said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ might have taken it. When this rumor circulated, Allah sent down,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا كَانَ لِنَبِيٍّ أَن يَغُلَّ وَمَن يَغْلُلْ يَأْتِ بِمَا غَلَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(It is not for any Prophet to illegally take a part of the booty, and whosoever is deceitful with the booty, he shall bring forth on the Day of Resurrection that which he took.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This was also recorded by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, who said \"Hasan Gharib\". This Ayah exonerates the Messenger of Allah ﷺ of all types of deceit and treachery, be it returning what was entrusted with him, dividing the spoils of war, etc.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah then said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَن يَغْلُلْ يَأْتِ بِمَا غَلَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا كَسَبَتْ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and whosoever is deceitful with the booty, he shall bring forth on the Day of Resurrection that which he took.

Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Malik Al-Ashja'i said that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَعْظَمُ الْغُلُولِ عِنْدَ اللهِ ذِرَاعٌ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ، تَجِدُون الرَّجُلَيْنِ جَارَيْنِ فِي الْأَرْضِ - أو فِي الدَّارِ - فَيَقْطَعُ أَحَدُهُمَا مِنْ حَظِّ صَاحِبِه ذِرَاعًا، فَإِذَا اقْتَطَعَهُ، طُوِّقَهُ مِنْ سَبْعِ أَرَضِينَ إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The worst Ghulul <span class=\"gray\">(i.e. stealing)</span> with Allah is a yard of land, that is, when you find two neighbors in a land or home and one of them illegally acquires a yard of his neighbor's land.

The Prophet ﷺ stood on the Minbar and said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا بَالُ الْعَامِلِ نَبْعَثُهُ فَيَجِيءُ فَيَقُولُ: هَذَا لَكُمْ، وَهَذَا أُهْدِيَ لِي، أَفَلَا جَلَسَ فِي بَيْتِ أَبِيهِ وَأُمِّهِ فَيَنْظُرُ أَيُهْدَى إِلَيْهِ أَمْ لَا؟ وَالَّذِي نَفْسُ مُحَمَّدٍ بِيَدِهِ، لَا يَأْتِي أَحَدٌ مِنْكُمْ مِنْهَا بِشَيْءٍ إِلَّا جَاءَ بِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عَلى رَقَبَتِهِ، إِنْ كَانَ بَعِيرًا لَهُ رُغَاءٌ، أَوْ بَقَرَةٌ لَهَا خُوَارٌ، أَوْ شَاةٌ تَيْعَرُ</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">ثم رفع يديه حتى رأينا عفرة إبطيه، ثم قال:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">\"اللَّهُمَّ هَلْ بَلَّغْت؟\"</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">ثلاثًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(What is the matter with a man whom we appoint to collect Zakah, when he returns he said, 'This is for you and this has been given to me as a gift.'

The Prophet then raised his hands till we saw the whiteness of his armpits, and he said thrice, 'O Allah! Haven't I conveyed Your Message.')</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Hisham bin 'Urwah added that Abu Humayd said, \"I have seen him with my eyes and heard him with my ears, and ask Zayd bin Thabit.\" This is recorded in the Two Sahihs .</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In the book of Ahkam of his Sunan, Abu 'Isa At-Tirmidhi recorded that Mu'adh bin Jabal said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent me to Yemen, but when I started on the journey, he sent for me to come back and said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَتَدْرِي لِمَ بَعَثْتُ إِلَيْكَ؟ لَا تُصِيبَنَّ شَيْئًا بِغَيْرِ إِذْنِي، فَإِنَّهُ غُلُولٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do you know why I summoned you back?

It has been revealed to me that your God is One God\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[18:110]</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلَّا إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشُونَ فِي الْأَسْوَاقِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We never sent before you any of the Messengers but verily, they ate food and walked in the markets)</span><span class=\"gray\">[25:20]</span>.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلَّا رِجَالًا نُّوحِي إِلَيْهِم مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَىٰ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And We sent not before you any but men unto whom We revealed, from among the people of townships)</span><span class=\"gray\">[12:109]</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا مَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالْإِنسِ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِّنكُمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you assembly of Jinn and mankind! \"Did not there come to you Messengers from among you…?\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[6:130]</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah's favor is perfected when His Messenger to the people is from their own kind, so that they are able to talk to him and inquire about the meanings of Allah's Word.
