When any of that food or drink remained, they used to keep it for the orphan until he or she ate it or it spoiled. This became difficult for the companions and they talked about it to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and Allah sent down the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْيَتَامَىٰ قُلْ إِصْلَاحٌ لَّهُمْ خَيْرٌ وَإِن تُخَالِطُوهُمْ فَإِخْوَانُكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they ask you about orphans. Say: \"The best thing is to work honestly in their property, and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers.\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:220]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Thereafter, they mixed their food and drink with food and drink of the orphans.\" Abu Dawud collected this statement. Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">حَتَّىٰ يَبْلُغَ أَشُدَّهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(until he <span class=\"gray\">(or she)</span> attains the age of full strength;)</span>, refers to reaching the age of adolescence, according to Ash-Sha'bi, Malik and several others among the Salaf.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Command to Give Full Measure and Full Weight with Justice</h2></div><p lang=\"de\" class=\"de \">Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَوْفُوا الْكَيْلَ وَالْمِيزَانَ بِالْقِسْطِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and give full measure and full weight with justice.)</span> is a command to establish justice while giving and taking. Allah has also warned against abandoning this commandment, when He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيْلٌ لِّلْمُطَفِّفِينَ - الَّذِينَ إِذَا اكْتَالُوا عَلَى النَّاسِ يَسْتَوْفُونَ - وَإِذَا كَالُوهُمْ أَو وَّزَنُوهُمْ يُخْسِرُونَ - أَلَا يَظُنُّ أُولَٰئِكَ أَنَّهُم مَّبْعُوثُونَ - لِيَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ - يَوْمَ يَقُومُ النَّاسُ لِرَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Woe to Al-Mutaffifin. Those who, when they have to receive by measure from men, demand full measure. And when they have to give by measure or weight to <span class=\"gray\">(other)</span> men, give less than due. Do they not think that they will be resurrected <span class=\"gray\">(for reckoning)</span>. On a Great Day? The Day when <span class=\"gray\">(all)</span> mankind will stand before the Lord of all that exists?)</span><span class=\"gray\">[83:1-6]</span>. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah destroyed an entire nation that was accustomed to giving less in weights and measures. Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> لَا نُكَلِّفُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We burden not any person, but that which he can bear.)</span> that is, whoever strives while pursuing his rights and giving other peoples' full rights, then there is no sin on him if he commits an honest mistake after trying his best and striving to do what is right.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Order for Just Testimony</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذَا قُلْتُمْ فَاعْدِلُوا وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And whenever you give your word, say the truth even if a near relative is concerned.)</span> This is similar to His statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُونُوا قَوَّامِينَ لِلَّهِ شُهَدَاءَ بِالْقِسْطِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allah as just witnesses.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[5:8]</span> And there is a similar Ayah in Surat An-Nisa'. So Allah commands justice in action and statement, with both near relatives and distant relatives. Indeed, Allah orders justice for everyone at all times and in all situations.</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Fulfilling the Covenant of Allah is an Obligation</h2></div><p lang=\"el-Latn\" class=\"el-Latn \">Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَبِعَهْدِ اللَّهِ أَوْفُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and fulfill the Covenant of Allah.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Jarir commented, \"Allah commands: Fulfill Allah's commandments that He has ordered you. You will do so when you obey Him in what He commanded, refrain from what He prohibited and abide by His Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger ﷺ.

The <span class=\"gray\">(straight)</span> path is Islam, the two walls are Allah's set limits, the open doors lead to Allah's prohibitions, the caller on the gate of the path is Allah's Book <span class=\"gray\">(the Qur'an)</span>, while the caller from above the path is Allah's admonition in the heart of every Muslim.)</span> At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i also recorded this Hadith, and At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Gharib.\" Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ السُّبُلَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so follow it, and follow not <span class=\"gray\">(other)</span> paths...)</span> describes Allah's path in the singular sense, because truth is one.
