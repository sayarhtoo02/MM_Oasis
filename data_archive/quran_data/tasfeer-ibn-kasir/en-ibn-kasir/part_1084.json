Perhaps Allah will turn unto them in forgiveness. Surely, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful <span>(102)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Some Believers stayed away from Battle because They were Lazy</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">After Allah explained the characteristics of the hypocrites who stayed away from battle because they sought to avoid it out of denial and doubt, He then mentioned the disobedient who stayed away from Jihad due to laziness and preferring comfort, even though they truely believed,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَآخَرُونَ اعْتَرَفُوا بِذُنُوبِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And others who have acknowledged their sins,)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">These people admitted their error to themselves and their Lord. They had performed good deeds before, as well as, this evil deed that they committed. For them there was forgiveness and pardon of Allah. This Ayah is general, covering all sinners who combine good and evil deeds, thus becoming partly impure, even though it was revealed about some people in specific. Ibn 'Abbas said that,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَآخَرُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And <span class=\"gray\">(there are)</span> others)</span>, refers to Abu Lubabah and some of his friends who stayed away from the battle of Tabuk and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ returned from that battle, this group, Abu Lubabah and five, seven or nine with him, tied themselves to the pillars of the Masjid and refused to let anyone untie them except the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. When this Ayah was revealed,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَآخَرُونَ اعْتَرَفُوا بِذُنُوبِهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And <span class=\"gray\">(there are)</span> others who have acknowledged their sins,)</span> the Messenger of Allah ﷺ untied them and pardoned them.\" Al-Bukhari recorded that Samurah bin Jundub said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to us,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَتَانِي اللَّيْلَةَ آتِيَانِ فَابْتَعَثَانِي، فَانْتَهَيَا بِي إِلَى مَدِينَةٍ مَبْنِيَّةٍ بِلَبِنِ ذَهَبٍ وَلَبِنِ فِضَّةٍ فَتَلَقَّانَا رِجَالٌ شَطْرٌ مِنْ خَلْقِهِمْ كَأَحْسَنِ مَا أَنْتَ رَاءٍ، وَشَطْرٌ كَأَقْبَحِ مَا أَنْتَ رَاءٍ، قَالَا لَهُمْ: اذْهَبُوا فَقَعُوا فِي ذَلِكَ النَّهْرِ فَوَقَعُوا فِيهِ ثُمَّ رَجَعُوا إِلَيْنَا قَدْ ذَهَبَ ذَلِكَ السُّوءُ عَنْهُمْ فَصَارُوا فِي أَحْسَنِ صُورَةٍ، قَالَا لِي: هَذِهِ جَنَّةُ عَدْنٍ وَهَذَا مَنْزِلُكَ، قَالَا: وَأَمَّا الْقَوْمُ الَّذِينَ كَانُوا شَطْرٌ مِنْهُمْ حَسَنٌ وَشَطْرٌ مِنْهُمْ قَبِيحٌ، فَإِنَّهُمْ خَلَطُوا عَمَلًا صَالِحًا وَآخَرَ سَيِّئًا تَجَاوَزَ اللهُ عَنْهُم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Last Night, two <span class=\"gray\">(angels)</span> came to me <span class=\"gray\">(in a vision)</span> and took me to a city, built with bricks made of gold and silver. We met some men who, part of their bodies were as handsome as you ever saw and the part as ugly as you ever saw. The two <span class=\"gray\">(angels)</span> ordered these men to go to a river and submerge themselves in it; they did that and came back to us, and the ugliness went away from them, thus becoming the most beautiful form. The two said to me, 'This is the garden of Eden, and this is your residence in it.' The two said, 'As for the men who had part of their body handsome and part ugly, they have mixed a deed that was righteous with another that was evil. Allah has pardoned them.')</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith in a short form upon the explanation of this Ayah.</p>"

Verily, your Salat are a Sakan for them; and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower <span>(103)</span>Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His servants and accepts the Sadaqat, and that Allah alone is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful <span>(104)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Command to collect the Zakah and Its Benefits</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah commanded His Messenger ﷺ to take Sadaqah from the Muslims' money to purify and sanctify them with it. This Ayah is general, even though some said that it refers specifically to those who mixed good and evil deeds, who admitted to their errors. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Some bedouin later thought that paying Zakah to the Leader was not legislated except to the Messenger ﷺ himself, using this Ayah as evidence,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ صَدَقَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Take Sadaqah from their wealth.)</span> Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and other Companions refuted this ill comprehension and fought against them until they paid the Zakah to the Khalifah, just as they used to pay it to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. As-Siddiq said, \"By Allah! If they abstain from paying a bridle that they used to pay to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, I will fight them for refraining from paying it.\" Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَصَلِّ عَلَيْهِمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and 'Şalli' for them)</span>, means, supplicate for them, and ask Allah to forgive them. In the Sahih, Muslim recorded that 'Abdullah bin Abi Awfa said, \"Whenever the Prophet ﷺ was brought charity, he used to invoke Allah for those who brought it. My father also brought his charity and the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى آلِ أَبِي أَوْفَى</p><p lang=\"sm\" class=\"sm \"><span class=\"gray\">(O Allah! I invoke You for the family of Abu Awfa.)</span>\" Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">إِنَّ صَلَاتَكَ سَكَنٌ لَّهُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, your Salat are a Sakan for them)</span>, means, a mercy for them, according to Ibn 'Abbas. Allah said next,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and Allah is All-Hearer,)</span> of your invocation <span class=\"gray\">(O Muhammad)</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">عَلِيمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(All-Knower.)</span> in those who deserve your invocation on their behalf, who are worthy of it. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ يَقْبَلُ التَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَأْخُذُ الصَّدَقَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His servants and accepts the Sadaqat?)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This Ayah encourages reverting to repentance and giving charity, for each of these actions erases, deletes and eradicate sins. Allah states that He accepts the repentance of those who repent to Him, as well as charity from pure resources, for Allah accepts it with His Right Hand and raises it for its giver until even a date becomes as large as Mount Uhud. Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ اللهَ يَقْبَلُ الصَّدَقَةَ وَيَأْخُذُهَا بِيَمِينِهِ فَيُرَبِّيهَا لِأَحَدِكُمْ كَمَا يُرَبِّي أَحَدُكُمْ مُهْرَهُ، حَتَّى إِنَّ اللُّقْمَةَ لَتَكُونُ مِثْلَ أُحُدٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, Allah accepts charity, receives it in His Right Hand and develops it for its giver, just as one of you raises his pony, until the bite <span class=\"gray\">[of food]</span> becomes as large as Uhud.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Book of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, testifies to this Hadith,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ يَقْبَلُ التَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَأْخُذُ الصَّدَقَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His servants and accepts the Sadaqat?)</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَمْحَقُ اللَّهُ الرِّبَا وَيُرْبِي الصَّدَقَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah will destroy Riba and will give increase for Sadaqat.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[2:276]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">'Abdullah bin Mas'ud said, \"Charity falls in Allah's Hand before it falls in the needy's hand,\" he then recited this Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ يَقْبَلُ التَّوْبَةَ عَنْ عِبَادِهِ وَيَأْخُذُ الصَّدَقَاتِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His servants and accepts the Sadaqat?)</span></p>"

Then He will inform you of what you used to do. <span>(105)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Warning the Disobedient</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Mujahid said that this Ayah carries a warning from Allah to those who defy His orders. Their deeds will be shown to Allah, Blessed and Most Honored, and to the Messenger ﷺ and the believers. This will certainly occur on the Day of Resurrection, just as Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَئِذٍ تُعْرَضُونَ لَا تَخْفَىٰ مِنكُمْ خَافِيَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(That Day shall you be brought to Judgement, not a secret of you will be hidden.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[69:18]</span>,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَ تُبْلَى السَّرَائِرُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The Day when all the secrets will be examined.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[86:9]</span>, and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَحُصِّلَ مَا فِي الصُّدُورِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And that which is in the breasts <span class=\"gray\">(of men)</span> shall be made known.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[100:10]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah might also expose some deeds to the people in this life. Al-Bukhari said that 'Aishah said, \"If the good deeds of a Muslim person please you, then say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اعْمَلُوا فَسَيَرَى اللَّهُ عَمَلَكُمْ وَرَسُولُهُ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do deeds! Allah will see your deeds, and <span class=\"gray\">(so will)</span> His Messenger and the believers.)</span>\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">There is a Hadith that carries a similar meaning. Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا عَلَيْكُمْ أَنْ تُعْجَبُوا بِأَحَدٍ حَتَّى تَنْظُرُوا بِمَ يُخْتَمُ لَهُ، فَإِنَّ الْعَامِلَ يَعْمَلُ زَمَانًا مِنْ عُمْرِهِ - أَوْ بَــرهَةً مِنْ دَهْرِهِ - بِعَمَلٍ صَالِحٍ لَوْ مَاتَ عَلَيْهِ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ ثُمَّ يَتَحَوَّلُ فَيَعْمَلُ عَمَلًا سَيِّئًا، وَإِنَّ الْعَبْدَ لَيَعْمَلُ الْبُرْهَةَ مِنْ دَهْرِهِ بِعَمَلٍ سَيِّءٍ، لَوْ مَاتَ عَلَيْهِ دَخَلَ النَّارَ ثُمَّ يَتَحَوَّلُ فَيَعْمَلُ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا، وَإِذَا أَرَادَ اللهُ بِعَبْدِهِ خَيْرًا اسْتَعْمَلَهُ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do not be pleased with someone's deeds until you see what his deeds in the end will be like. Verily, one might work for some time of his life with good deeds, so that if he dies while doing it, he will enter Paradise. However, he changes and commits evil deeds. And one might commit evil deeds for some time in his life, so that if he dies while doing them he will enter the Fire. However, he changes and performs good deeds. If Allah wants the good of a servant He employs him before he dies.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He was asked, \"How would Allah employ him, O Allah's Messenger?\" He said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُوَفِّقُهُ لِعَمِلٍ صَالِحٍ ثُمَّ يَقْبِضُهُ عَلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He directs him to perform good deeds and takes his life in that condition.)</span> Only Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith.</p>"
