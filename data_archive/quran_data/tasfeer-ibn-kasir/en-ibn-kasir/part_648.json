    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Those <span class=\"gray\">(angels)</span> who bear the Throne <span class=\"gray\">(of Allah)</span> and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe <span class=\"gray\">(saying)</span>: \"Our Lord! You comprehend all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repent and follow Your way, and save them from the torment of the blazing Fire <span>(7)</span>Our Lord! And make them enter the 'Adn <span class=\"gray\">(Eternal)</span> Gardens which you have promised them – and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their offspring! Verily, You are the Almighty, the All-Wise <span>(8)</span>And save them from the sins, and whomsoever You save from the sins that Day, him verily, You have taken into mercy.\" And that is the supreme success <span>(9)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Bearers of the Throne praise Allah and pray for forgiveness for the Believers</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah tells us that the angels who are close to Him, the bearers of the Throne, and the angels who are around Him – all glorify the praises of their Lord. They combine glorification <span class=\"gray\">(Tasbih)</span> which implies that He is free of any shortcomings, with praise <span class=\"gray\">(Tahmid)</span> which is an affirmation of praise.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and believe in Him,)</span> means, they humbly submit themselves before Him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and ask forgiveness for those who believe)</span> means, for those among the people of earth who believe in the Unseen. Allah commanded that His angels who are close to Him should pray for the believers in their absence, so it is a part of the angels' nature that they say Amin when a believer prays for his brother in his absence. In Sahih Muslim it says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِذَا دَعَا الْمُسْلِمُ لِأَخِيهِ بِظَهْرِ الْغَيْبِ قَالَ الْمَلَكُ: آمِينَ وَلَكَ بِمِثْلِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When a Muslim prays for his brother in his absence, the angel says, 'Amin, and may you have something similar to it'.)</span>\" Shahr bin Hawshab said, \"The bearers of the Throne are eight; four of them say, 'Glory and praise be to You, O Allah, to You be praise for Your forebearance after Your knowledge. ' Four of them say, 'Glory and praise be to You, O Allah, to You be praise for Your forgiveness after Your power.' When they pray for forgiveness for those who believe, they say:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبَّنَا وَسِعْتَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ رَحْمَةً وَعِلْمًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Our Lord! You comprehend all things in mercy and knowledge,)</span> meaning, 'Your mercy encompasses their sins and Your knowledge encompasses all their deeds, words and action.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> فَاغْفِرْ لِلَّذِينَ تَابُوا وَاتَّبَعُوا سَبِيلَكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so forgive those who repent and follow Your way.)</span>\" That is, 'forgive the sinners when they repent to You and turn to You and give up their former ways, following Your commands to do good and abstain from evil.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقِهِمْ عَذَابَ الْجَحِيمِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and save them from the torment of the blazing Fire!)</span> means, 'snatch them away from the punishment of Hell, which is a painful, agonizing punishment.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبَّنَا وَأَدْخِلْهُمْ جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ الَّتِي وَعَدْتَهُمْ وَمَنْ صَلَحَ مِنْ آبَائِهِمْ وَأَزْوَاجِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّاتِهِمْ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Our Lord! And make them enter the 'Adn <span class=\"gray\">(Eternal)</span> Gardens which you have promised them – and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their offspring!)</span> meaning, 'bring them together so that they may find delight in one another in neighboring dwellings. ' This is like the Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُمْ بِإِيمَانٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَا أَلَتْنَاهُمْ مِنْ عَمَلِهِمْ مِنْ شَيْءٍ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, – to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything)</span><span class=\"gray\">(52:21)</span>. </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This means, 'that all of them will be made equal in status. In this way they may delight in one another's company; the one who is in the higher status will not lose anything. On the contrary We will raise the one whose deeds are of a lower status so that they will become equal, as a favor and a blessing from Us.'</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Sa'id bin Jubayr said that when the believer enters Paradise, he will ask where his father, son and brother are. It will be said to him, 'they did not reach the same level of good deeds as you did'. He will say, 'but I did it for my sake and for theirs.' Then they will be brought to join him in that higher degree. Then Sa'id bin Jubayr recited this Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبَّنَا وَأَدْخِلْهُمْ جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ الَّتِي وَعَدْتَهُمْ وَمَنْ صَلَحَ مِنْ آبَائِهِمْ وَأَزْوَاجِهِمْ وَذُرِّيَّاتِهِمْ ۚ إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Our Lord! And make them enter the 'Adn <span class=\"gray\">(Eternal)</span> Gardens which you have promised them – and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their offspring! Verily, You are the Almighty, the All-Wise.)</span> Mutarrif bin 'Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir said, \"The most sincere of the servants of Allah towards the believers are the angels.\" Then he recited this Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَبَّنَا وَأَدْخِلْهُمْ جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ الَّتِي وَعَدْتَهُمْ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Our Lord! And make them enter the 'Adn <span class=\"gray\">(Eternal)</span> Paradises which you have promised them)</span> He then said, \"The most treacherous of the servants of Allah towards the believers are the Shayatin.\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(You are the Almighty, the All-Wise.)</span> means, 'the One Whom none can resist or overwhelm; what You will happens and what You do not will does not happen; You are Wise in all that You say and do, in all that You legislate and decree.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقِهِمُ السَّيِّئَاتِ ۚ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And save them from the sins,)</span> means, the actions and the consequences.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَنْ تَقِ السَّيِّئَاتِ يَوْمَئِذٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and whomsoever You save from the sins that Day,)</span> means, the Day of Resurrection,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَقَدْ رَحِمْتَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(him verily, You have taken into mercy.)</span> means, 'You have protected him and saved him from punishment.'</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And that is the supreme success.)</span></p>"

Camels may be ridden or eaten; their milk is drunk and they are used for carrying heavy burdens on journeys to distant lands. Cattle are eaten and their milk is drunk; they are also used for plowing the earth. Sheep are eaten and their milk is also drunk. The hair and wool of all of these animals is used to make tents, clothing and furnishings, as we have already discussed in Surat Al-An'am and Surat An-Nahl, etc. Allah says here:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">اللَّهُ الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَنْعَامَ لِتَرْكَبُوا مِنْهَا وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ - وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَنَافِعُ وَلِتَبْلُغُوا عَلَيْهَا حَاجَةً فِي صُدُورِكُمْ وَعَلَيْهَا وَعَلَى الْفُلْكِ تُحْمَلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Allah, it is He Who has made cattle for you, that you may ride on some of them, and of some you eat.
