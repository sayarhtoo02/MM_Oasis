Ad-Dahhak said in his Tafsir:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا مِنَّا إِلَّا لَهُ مَقَامٌ مَعْلُومٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"<span class=\"gray\">(And there is not one of us <span class=\"gray\">(angels)</span> but has his known place;)</span> Masruq used to narrate that 'A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, 'The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا مَوْضِعٌ إِلَّا عَلَيْهِ مَلَكٌ سَاجِدٌ أَوْ قَائِمٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is no place in the lower heaven without an angel standing or prostrating in it.)</span> This is what Allah says:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا مِنَّا إِلَّا لَهُ مَقَامٌ مَعْلُومٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And there is not one of us <span class=\"gray\">(angels)</span> but has his known place <span class=\"gray\">(or position)</span>)</span>.\" It was reported that Ibn Mas'ud said, \"In the heavens there is one heaven in which there is no space a hand span wide but there is the forehead or the foot of an angel on it. \" Then he recited:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَا مِنَّا إِلَّا لَهُ مَقَامٌ مَعْلُومٌ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And there is not one of us <span class=\"gray\">(angels)</span> but has his known place;)</span> Sa'id bin Jubayr similarly said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الصَّافُّونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And we <span class=\"gray\">(angels)</span>, we stand in rows.)</span> means, we stand in rows to worship, as we have already seen in the Ayah</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالصَّافَّاتِ صَفًّا </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(By those ranged in ranks <span class=\"gray\">(or rows)</span>)</span> Abu Nadrah said, \"When the Iqamah had been given, 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, would turn to face the people and say: 'Make your rows straight, for Allah wants you to follow the ways of the angels.' Then he would say,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الصَّافُّونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, we stand in rows;)</span> 'Move back, O so-and-so, move forward, O so-and-so.' Then he would go forward and say 'Allahu Akbar'.\" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">In Sahih Muslim it is narrated that Hudhayfah, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فُضِّلْنَا عَلَى النَّاسِ بِثَلَاثٍ: جُعِلَتْ صُفُوفُنَا كَصُفُوفِ الْمَلَائِكَةِ،وَجُعِلَتْ لَنَا الْأَرْضُ مَسْجِدًا، وَتُرْبَتُهَا طَهُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(We have been favored above mankind in three things: our rows have been made like the rows of the angels; the whole earth has been made a place of prayer for us; and its soil is a means of purification for us.)</span>\"</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنَّا لَنَحْنُ الْمُسَبِّحُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And verily, we indeed are those who glorify.)</span> means, 'we stand in rows and glorify the Lord, praising Him, sanctifying Him and declaring Him to be above any faults or shortcomings. We are servants of Him and in need of Him, humbling ourselves before Him.'</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Quraysh wished that They could have a Reminder as had the Men of old</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِنْ كَانُوا لَيَقُولُونَ - لَوْ أَنَّ عِنْدَنَا ذِكْرًا مِنَ الْأَوَّلِينَ - لَكُنَّا عِبَادَ اللَّهِ الْمُخْلَصِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And indeed they used to say: \"If we had a reminder as had the men of old, we would have indeed been the chosen servants of Allah!\")</span> means, 'they used to wish – before you, O Muhammad, came to them – that they would have someone to remind them about Allah and what happened in earlier times, and to bring them the Book of Allah.' This is like the Ayat:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَأَقْسَمُوا بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ لَئِنْ جَاءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ لَيَكُونُنَّ أَهْدَىٰ مِنْ إِحْدَى الْأُمَمِ ۖ فَلَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ نَذِيرٌ مَا زَادَهُمْ إِلَّا نُفُورًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they swore by Allah their most binding oath that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than any of the nations <span class=\"gray\">(before them)</span>; yet when a warner came to them, it increased in them naught but flight <span class=\"gray\">(from the truth)</span>.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(35:42)</span>, and</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنْ تَقُولُوا إِنَّمَا أُنْزِلَ الْكِتَابُ عَلَىٰ طَائِفَتَيْنِ مِنْ قَبْلِنَا وَإِنْ كُنَّا عَنْ دِرَاسَتِهِمْ لَغَافِلِينَ - أَوْ تَقُولُوا لَوْ أَنَّا أُنْزِلَ عَلَيْنَا الْكِتَابُ لَكُنَّا أَهْدَىٰ مِنْهُمْ ۚ فَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ ۚ فَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنْ كَذَّبَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَصَدَفَ عَنْهَا ۗ سَنَجْزِي الَّذِينَ يَصْدِفُونَ عَنْ آيَاتِنَا سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ بِمَا كَانُوا يَصْدِفُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Lest you should say: \"The Book was sent down only to two sects before us, and for our part, we were in fact unaware of what they studied.\" Or lest you should say: \"If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have been better guided than they.\" So now has come unto you a clear proof from your Lord, and a form of guidance and a mercy. Who then does more wrong than one who rejects the Ayat of Allah and turns away therefrom? We shall requite those who turn away from Our Ayat with an evil torment, because of their turning away.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(6:156-157)</span> Allah says here:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَكَفَرُوا بِهِ ۖ فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But they disbelieve therein, so they will come to know!)</span> This is a definite and stern threat because of their disbelief in their Lord and their rejection of His Messenger ﷺ.</p>"
