    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">As for man, when his Lord tries him by giving him honor and bounties, then he says: \"My Lord has honored me. <span>(15)</span>But when He tries him by straitening his means of life, he says: \"My Lord has humiliated me! <span>(16)</span>But no! But you treat not the orphans with kindness and generosity <span>(17)</span>And urge not one another on the feeding of the Miskin <span>(18)</span>And you devour the Turath – devouring with greed <span>(19)</span>And you love wealth with love Jamma <span>(20)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Wealth and Poverty are both a Test and Honor or Disgrace for the Servant</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah refutes man in his belief that if Allah gives Him abundant provisions to test him with it, it is out of His honor for him. But this is not the case, rather it is a trial and a test, as Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّمَا نُمِدُّهُم بِهِ مِن مَّالٍ وَبَنِينَ - نُسَارِعُ لَهُمْ فِي الْخَيْرَاتِ ۚ بَل لَّا يَشْعُرُونَ </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do they think that in wealth and children with which We enlarge them. We hasten unto them with good things. Nay, but they perceive not.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(23:55-56)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Likewise, from another angle, if Allah tests him and tries him by curtailing his sustenance, he believes that is because Allah is humiliating him. As Allah says,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">كَلَّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But no!)</span> meaning, the matter is not as he claims, neither in this nor in that. For indeed Allah gives wealth to those whom He loves as well as those whom He does not love. Likewise, He withholds sustenance from those whom He loves and those whom He does not love. The point is that Allah should be obeyed in either circumstance. If one is wealthy, he should thank Allah for that, and if he is poor, he should exercise patience.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">From the Evil that the Servant does regarding Wealth</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَل لَّا تُكْرِمُونَ الْيَتِيمَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(But you treat not the orphans with kindness and generosity!)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This contains the command to honor him <span class=\"gray\">(the orphan)</span>. Abu Dawud recorded from Sahl bin Sa'id that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَنَا وَكَافِلُ الْيَتِيمِ كَهَاتَيْنِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(The guardian of the orphan and I will be like these two in Paradise.)</span> And he put his two fingers together - the middle finger and the index finger.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَحَاضُّونَ عَلَىٰ طَعَامِ الْمِسْكِينِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And urge not one another on the feeding of the Miskin!)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, they do not command that the poor and the needy be treated with kindness, nor do they encourage each other to do so.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتَأْكُلُونَ التُّرَاثَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And you devour the Turath)</span> meaning, the inheritance.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَكْلًا لَّمًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(devouring with greed.)</span> meaning, however they can get it, whether lawful or forbidden.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَتُحِبُّونَ الْمَالَ حُبًّا جَمًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And you love wealth with love Jamma.)</span> meaning, in abundance. This increases some of them in their wickedness.</p>"

    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Nay! When the earth is flatened, Dakkan Dakka <span>(21)</span>And your Lord comes with the angels in rows <span>(22)</span>And Hell will be brought near that Day. On that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance avail him <span>(23)</span>He will say: \"Alas!

He says,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">كَلَّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Nay!)</span> meaning, truly.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\"> إِذَا دُكَّتِ الْأَرْضُ دَكًّا دَكًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(When the earth is flatened, Dakkan Dakka.)</span> meaning, the earth and the mountains will be flattened, leveled and made even, and the creatures will rise from their graves for their Lord.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجَاءَ رَبُّكَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And your Lord comes)</span> meaning, for the session of Judgement between His creatures. This is after they requested the best of the Sons of Adam – Muhammad ﷺ – to intercede with Allah. This will occur only after they have requested the other great Messengers, one after another. Yet, all of them will say, \"I cannot do that for you.\" This will continue until the beseeching of the men reaches Muhammad ﷺ, and he will say, \"I will do it, I will do it.\" So he will go and seek to intercede with Allah as the session of Judgement will have come, and Allah will allow him to intercede for that <span class=\"gray\">(the Judgement)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This will be the first of the intercessions, and it is the praiseworthy station that has already been discussed in Surat Subhan <span class=\"gray\">(Al-Isra')</span>. So Allah will come for the session of Judgement as He wills, and the angels will also come, lined up in rows upon rows before Him. Then Allah says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَجِيءَ يَوْمَئِذٍ بِجَهَنَّمَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Hell will be brought near that Day.)</span> In his Sahih, Imam Muslim bin Al-Hajjaj recorded that 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يُؤْتَى بِجَهَنَّمَ يَوْمَئِذٍ لَهَا سَبْعُونَ أَلْفَ زِمَامٍ مَعَ كُلِّ زِمَام سَبْعُونَ أَلْفَ مَلَكٍ يَجُرُّونَهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Hell will be brought on near that Day and it will have seventy thousand leashes, and each leash will have seventy thousand angels pulling it.)</span></p><p lang=\"it\" class=\"it \">At-Tirmidhi also recorded the same narration. Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَذَكَّرُ الْإِنسَانُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(On that Day will man remember,)</span> meaning, his deeds, and what he did before in his past and recent times.</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\"> وَأَنَّىٰ لَهُ الذِّكْرَىٰ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(but how will that remembrance avail him?)</span> meaning, how can remembrance then benefit him</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَقُولُ يَا لَيْتَنِي قَدَّمْتُ لِحَيَاتِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He will say: \"Alas! Would that I had sent forth for my life!\")</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">meaning, if he was a disobedient person, he will be sorry for the acts of disobedience he committed. If he was an obedient person, he will wish that he performed more acts of obdedience.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is similar to what Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded from Muhammad bin Abi 'Amirah, who was one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He said, \"If a servant fell down on his face <span class=\"gray\">(in prostration)</span> from the day that he was born until the day he died as an old man, in obedience to Allah, he would scorn this act on the Day of Judgement. He would wish to be returned to this life so that he could earn more reward and compensation.\" </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah then says,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَيَوْمَئِذٍ لَّا يُعَذِّبُ عَذَابَهُ أَحَدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(So on that Day none will punish as He will punish.)</span> meaning, there is no one more severely punished than those whom Allah punishes for disobeying Him.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا يُوثِقُ وَثَاقَهُ أَحَدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And none will bind as He will bind.)</span> meaning, there is no one who is more severely punished and bound than those the Az-Zabaniyah punish the disbelievers in their Lord. This is for the criminals and the wrongdoers among the creatures. In reference to the pure and tranquil soul – which is always at rest and abiding by the truth it will be said to it,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيَّتُهَا النَّفْسُ الْمُطْمَئِنَّةُ - ارْجِعِي إِلَىٰ رَبِّكِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O tranquil soul! Come back to your Lord.)</span> meaning, to His company, His reward and what He has prepared for His servants in His Paradise.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">رَاضِيَةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(well-pleased)</span> meaning, within itself.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَّرْضِيَّةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(well-pleasing.)</span> meaning, pleased with Allah, and He will be pleased with it and gratify it.</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَادْخُلِي فِي عِبَادِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Enter then among My servants,)</span> meaning, among their ranks.</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">وَادْخُلِي جَنَّتِي</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And enter My Paradise!)</span> This will be said to it at the time of death and on the Day of Judgement. This is like the angels giving glad tiding to the believer at his time of death and when he rises from his grave. Likewise is this statement here.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Ibn 'Abbas concerning Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيَّتُهَا النَّفْسُ الْمُطْمَئِنَّةُ - ارْجِعِي إِلَىٰ رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةً مَّرْضِيَّةً</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O tranquil soul! Come back to your Lord, well-pleased and well-pleasing!)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">He said, \"This Ayah was revealed while Abu Bakr was sitting <span class=\"gray\">(with the Prophet ﷺ)</span>. So he said, 'O Messenger of Allah! There is nothing better than this!' The Prophet ﷺ then replied,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَمَا إِنَّهُ سَيُقَالُ لَكَ هَذَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(This will indeed be said to you.)</span>\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Fajr, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah.</p>"
