And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise <span>(240)</span>And for divorced women, maintenance <span class=\"gray\">(should be provided)</span> on reasonable <span class=\"gray\">(scale)</span>. This is a duty on Al-Muttaqin <span class=\"gray\">(the pious)</span><span>(241)</span>Thus Allah makes clear His Ayat <span class=\"gray\">(Laws)</span> to you, in order that you may understand <span>(242)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:240)</span> was abrogated</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The majority of the scholars said that this Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:240)</span> was abrogated by the Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:234)</span>, what Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنفُسِهِنَّ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...they <span class=\"gray\">(the wives)</span> shall wait <span class=\"gray\">(as regards their marriage)</span> for four months and ten days.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:234)</span></p><p lang=\"cy\" class=\"cy \">For instance, Al-Bukhari reported that Ibn Az-Zubayr said: I said to 'Uthman bin 'Affan:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those of you who die and leave wives behind them)</span> was abrogated by the other Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:234)</span>. Therefore, why did you collect it <span class=\"gray\">(meaning, in the Qur'an)</span>?\" He said, \"O my nephew! I shall not change any part of the Qur'an from its place.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The question that Ibn Az-Zubayr asked 'Uthman means: 'If the ruling of the Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:240)</span> was abrogated to four months <span class=\"gray\">(the 'Iddah of the widow, and refer to 2:234)</span>, then what is the wisdom behind including it in the Qur'an, although its ruling has been abrogated? If the Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:240)</span> remains <span class=\"gray\">(in the Qur'an)</span> after the Ayah that abrogated it <span class=\"gray\">(2:234)</span>, this might imply that its ruling is still valid.' 'Uthman, the Leader of the faithful, answered him by stating that this is a matter of the revelation, which mentioned these Ayat in this order. 'Therefore, I shall leave the Ayah where I found it in the Qur'an.'</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abu Hatim reported that Ibn 'Abbas said about what Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا وَصِيَّةً لِّأَزْوَاجِهِم مَّتَاعًا إِلَى الْحَوْلِ غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year's maintenance <span class=\"gray\">(and residence)</span> without turning them out,)</span> \"The widow used to reside, and have her provisions provided for her for a year, in her deceased husband's house. Later, the Ayah that specified the inheritance <span class=\"gray\">(4:12)</span> abrogated this Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:240)</span>, and thus the widow inherits one-fourth or one-eighth of what her <span class=\"gray\">(deceased)</span> husband leaves behind.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ibn Abu Hatim also related that 'Ali bin Abu Talhah stated that Ibn 'Abbas said, \"When a man died and left behind a widow, she used to remain in his house for a year for her 'Iddah, all the while receiving her provisions during this time. Thereafter, Allah revealed this Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا يَتَرَبَّصْنَ بِأَنفُسِهِنَّ أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they <span class=\"gray\">(the wives)</span> shall wait <span class=\"gray\">(as regards their marriage)</span> for four months and ten days.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:234)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So, this is the 'Iddah of the widow, unless she was pregnant, for her 'Iddah then ends when she gives birth. Allah also said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَهُنَّ الرُّبُعُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُمْ إِن لَّمْ يَكُن لَّكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَإِن كَانَ لَكُمْ وَلَدٌ فَلَهُنَّ الثُّمُنُ مِمَّا تَرَكْتُم</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(In that which you leave, their <span class=\"gray\">(your wives')</span> share is a fourth if you leave no child; but if you leave a child, they get an eighth of that which you leave.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(4:12)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So Allah specified the share of the widow in the inheritance and there was no need for the will or the Nafaqah <span class=\"gray\">(maintenance)</span> which were mentioned in <span class=\"gray\">(2:240)</span>.\"</p><p lang=\"ha\" class=\"ha \">Ibn Abu Hatim stated that Mujahid, Al-Hasan, 'Ikrimah, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi' and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that the Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:240)</span> was abrogated by:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">أَرْبَعَةَ أَشْهُرٍ وَعَشْرًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(four months and ten days.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:234)</span></p><p lang=\"hmn\" class=\"hmn \">Al-Bukhari reported that Mujahid said that:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those of you who die and leave wives behind them)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:234)</span> used to be the 'Iddah, and the widow had to remain with her <span class=\"gray\">(deceased)</span> husband's family <span class=\"gray\">(during that period, i.e., four months and ten days)</span>. Then, Allah revealed:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّذِينَ يُتَوَفَّوْنَ مِنكُمْ وَيَذَرُونَ أَزْوَاجًا وَصِيَّةً لِّأَزْوَاجِهِم مَّتَاعًا إِلَى الْحَوْلِ غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ فَإِنْ خَرَجْنَ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِي مَا فَعَلْنَ فِي أَنفُسِهِنَّ مِن مَّعْرُوفٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year's maintenance <span class=\"gray\">(and residence)</span> without turning them out, but if they <span class=\"gray\">(wives)</span> leave, there is no sin on you for that which they do of themselves, provided it is honorable <span class=\"gray\">(e.g., lawful marriage)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So, Allah made the rest of the year, which is seven months and twenty days, as a will and testament for her. Consequently, if she wants, she could use her right in this will and remain in the residence <span class=\"gray\">(for the rest of the year)</span>. Or, if she wants, she could leave the <span class=\"gray\">(deceased husband's)</span> house after the four months and ten days have passed. This is the meaning of what Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ فَإِنْ خَرَجْنَ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...without turning them out, but if they <span class=\"gray\">(wives)</span> leave, there is no sin on you.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Therefore, the required term of 'Iddah is still unchanged <span class=\"gray\">(refer to 2:234)</span>.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ata' quoted Ibn 'Abbas, \"This Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:240)</span> has abrogated <span class=\"gray\">(the requirement that)</span> the widow spends the 'Iddah with his <span class=\"gray\">(i.e., her deceased husband's)</span> family. So, she spends her 'Iddah wherever she wants. This is the meaning of what Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">غَيْرَ إِخْرَاجٍ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(without turning them out,)</span>.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ata' also said: \"If she wants, she spends the 'Iddah with his family and resides there according to the will <span class=\"gray\">(meaning the rest of the year)</span>. If she wants, she is allowed to leave, for Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا فَعَلْنَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(there is no sin on you for that which they do of themselves,)</span>.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Ata' then said: \"Then <span class=\"gray\">(the Ayah on)</span> the inheritance <span class=\"gray\">(refer to 4:12)</span> came and abrogated the residence. Hence, the widow spends her 'Iddah wherever she wants and does not have the right to residence any more.\"</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The statement of 'Ata' and those who held the view that the Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:240)</span> was abrogated by the Ayah on the inheritance <span class=\"gray\">(4: 12)</span>, is only valid for more than the four months and ten days <span class=\"gray\">(required in 2:234)</span>. However, if they mean that the four months and ten days are not required from the deceased husband's estate, then this opinion is the subject of disagreement among the scholars. As proof, they said that the widow is required to remain in her <span class=\"gray\">(deceased)</span> husband's house <span class=\"gray\">(for four months and ten days)</span> according to what Malik reported from Zaynab bint Ka'b bin 'Ujrah. She said that Fari'ah bint Malik bin Sinan, the sister of Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri, told her that she came to Allah's Messenger ﷺ asking him to return to her family's residence with Banu Khudrah. Her husband had pursued some of his servants who ran away, but when he reached the area of Al-Qadum, they killed him. She said, \"So I asked Allah's Messenger ﷺ if I should stay with my family in Banu Khudrah, for my <span class=\"gray\">(deceased)</span> husband did not leave me a residence that he owns or Nafaqah <span class=\"gray\">(maintenance)</span>. Allah's Messenger ﷺ answered in the positive. While I was in the room, Allah's Messenger ﷺ summoned me or had someone summon me and said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَيْفَ قُلْتِ؟</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(What did you say?)</span> I repeated the story to him about my <span class=\"gray\">(deceased)</span> husband. He said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">امْكُثي فِي بَيْتِكِ حَتَّى يَبْلُغَ الكِتَابُ أَجَلَهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Stay at your home until the term reaches its end.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">So I remained through the 'Iddah term for four months and ten days in my <span class=\"gray\">(deceased husband's)</span> house. Thereafter, 'Uthman bin 'Affan sent for me during his reign and asked me about this matter and I told him what happened. He made a judgment to the same effect.\" This Hadith was also collected by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih\".</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Necessity of the Mut'ah <span class=\"gray\">(Gift)</span> at the Time of Divorce</h2></div><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَاتِ مَتَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And for divorced women, maintenance <span class=\"gray\">(should be provided)</span> on reasonable <span class=\"gray\">(scale)</span>. This is a duty on Al-Muttaqin <span class=\"gray\">(the pious)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"ha\" class=\"ha \">Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that when Allah's statement:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَتَاعًا بِالْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُحْسِنِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...a gift of reasonable amount is a duty on the doers of good)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:236)</span> was revealed, a man said, \"If I want, I will be excellent and if I do not, I will not.\" Thereafter, Allah revealed this Ayah:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَاتِ مَتَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُتَّقِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And for divorced women, maintenance <span class=\"gray\">(should be provided)</span> on reasonable <span class=\"gray\">(scale)</span>. This is a duty on Al-Muttaqin <span class=\"gray\">(the pious)</span>.)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The scholars who ruled that the Mut'ah <span class=\"gray\">(reasonable gift)</span> at the time of divorce is required for every divorced woman, whether she had a bridal-money appointed for her or not, and whether the marriage was consummated or not, relied on this Ayah <span class=\"gray\">(2:241)</span> when they issued their ruling. This is the view taken on this subject by Sa'id bin Jubayr and several others among the Salaf and also Ibn Jarir. Hence, Allah's statement:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِن طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَاءَ مَا لَمْ تَمَسُّوهُنَّ أَوْ تَفْرِضُوا لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً وَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ عَلَى الْمُوسِعِ قَدَرُهُ وَعَلَى الْمُقْتِرِ قَدَرُهُ مَتَاعًا بِالْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُحْسِنِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(There is no sin on you, if you divorce women while yet you have not touched <span class=\"gray\">(had sexual relation with)</span> them, nor appointed for them their due <span class=\"gray\">(dowry)</span>. But bestow on them <span class=\"gray\">(a suitable gift)</span>, the rich according to his means, and the poor according to his means, a gift of reasonable amount is a duty on the doers of good.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(2:236)</span> only mentions some specifics of this general ruling.</p><p lang=\"ceb\" class=\"ceb \">Allah then said:</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Thus Allah makes clear His Ayat <span class=\"gray\">(Laws)</span> to you,)</span> meaning, what He allows, forbids, requires, His set limits, His commandments and His prohibitions are all explained and made plain and clear for you. He did not leave any matter in general terms if you needed the specifics,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(in order that you may understand.)</span> meaning, understand and comprehend.</p>"
