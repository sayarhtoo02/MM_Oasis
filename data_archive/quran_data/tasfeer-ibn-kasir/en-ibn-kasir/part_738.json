    "text": "<p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">O People of the Scripture! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of Allah except the truth. Al-Masih 'Isa, son of Maryam, was <span class=\"gray\">(no more than)</span> a Messenger of Allah and His Word, which He bestowed on Maryam and a spirit from <span class=\"gray\">[created by]</span> Him; so believe in Allah and His Messengers. Say not: \"Three!\" Cease! <span class=\"gray\">(it is)</span> better for you. For Allah is <span class=\"gray\">(the only)</span> One God, hallowed be He above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs <span>(171)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>Prohibiting the People of the Book From Going to Extremes in Religion</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Allah forbids the People of the Scriptures from going to extremes in religion, which is a common trait of theirs, especially among the Christians. The Christians exaggerated over 'Isa until they elevated him above the grade that Allah gave him. They elevated him from the rank of prophethood to being a god, whom they worshipped just as they worshipped Allah. They exaggerated even more in the case of those who they claim were his followers, claiming that they were inspired, thus following every word they uttered whether true or false, be it guidance or misguidance, truth or lies. This is why Allah said,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">اتَّخَذُوا أَحْبَارَهُمْ وَرُهْبَانَهُمْ أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(They took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allah.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[9:31]</span> Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said that 'Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَا تُطْرُونِي كَمَا أَطْرَتِ النَّصَارَىِ عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ. فَإِنَّمَا أَنَا عَبْدٌ فَقُولُوا: عَبْدُاللهِ وَرَسُولُهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Do not unduly praise me like the Christians exaggerated over 'Isa, son of Maryam. Verily, I am only a servant, so say, 'Allah's servant and His Messenger.')</span> This is the wording of Al-Bukhari.</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said that a man once said, \"O Muhammad! You are our master and the son of our master, our most righteous person and the son of our most righteous person...\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ! عَلَيْكُمْ بِقَوْلِكُمْ، وَلَا يَسْتَهْوِيَنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ، أَنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ عَبْدِ اللهِ، عَبْدُ اللهِ وَرَسُولُهُ، وَاللهِ مَا أُحِبُّ أَنْ تَرْفَعُونِي فَوْقَ مَنْزِلَتِي الَّتِي أَنْزَلَنِي اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(O people! Say what you have to say, but do not allow Shaytan to trick you. I am Muhammad bin 'Abdullah, Allah's servant and Messenger. By Allah! I do not like that you elevate me above the rank that Allah has granted me.)</span> Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَقُولُوا عَلَى اللَّهِ إِلَّا الْحَقَّ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(nor say of Allah except the truth.)</span> means, do not lie and claim that Allah has a wife or a son, Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him. Allah is glorified, praised, and honored in His might, grandure and greatness, and there is no deity worthy of worship nor Lord but Him. Allah said;</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّمَا الْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ وَكَلِمَتُهُ أَلْقَاهَا إِلَىٰ مَرْيَمَ وَرُوحٌ مِّنْهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Al-Masih 'Isa, son of Maryam, was <span class=\"gray\">(no more than)</span> a Messenger of Allah and His Word, which He bestowed on Maryam and a spirit from <span class=\"gray\">[created by]</span> Him;)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">'Isa is only one of Allah's servants and one of His creatures. Allah said to him, 'Be', and he was, and He sent him as a Messenger. 'Isa was a word from Allah that He bestowed on Maryam, meaning He created him with the word 'Be' that He sent with Jibril to Maryam. Jibril blew the life of 'Isa into Maryam by Allah's leave, and 'Isa came to existence as a result. This incident was in place of the normal conception between man and woman that results in children. This is why 'Isa was a word and a Ruh <span class=\"gray\">(spirit)</span> created by Allah, as he had no father to conceive him. Rather, he came to existence through the word that Allah uttered, 'Be,' and he was, through the life that Allah sent with Jibril. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَّا الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ إِلَّا رَسُولٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِ الرُّسُلُ وَأُمُّهُ صِدِّيقَةٌ كَانَا يَأْكُلَانِ الطَّعَامَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Al-Masih <span class=\"gray\">('Isa)</span>, son of Maryam, was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before him. His mother <span class=\"gray\">(Maryam)</span> was a Siddiqah. They both ate food.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[5:75]</span> And Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَىٰ عِندَ اللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ آدَمَ خَلَقَهُ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Verily, the likeness of 'Isa before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then <span class=\"gray\">(He)</span> said to him: \"Be! ـ and he was.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[3:59]</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَالَّتِي أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا فَنَفَخْنَا فِيهَا مِن رُّوحِنَا وَجَعَلْنَاهَا وَابْنَهَا آيَةً لِّلْعَالَمِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And she who guarded her chastity, We breathed into her <span class=\"gray\">(garment)</span> and We made her and her son <span class=\"gray\">['Isa]</span> a sign for all that exits.)</span><span class=\"gray\">(21:91)</span></p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَمَرْيَمَ ابْنَتَ عِمْرَانَ الَّتِي أَحْصَنَتْ فَرْجَهَا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And Maryam, the daughter of 'Imran who guarded her chastity,)</span><span class=\"gray\">[66:12]</span> and Allah said concerning the Messiah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He <span class=\"gray\">['Isa]</span> was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him.)</span></p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Meaning of \"His Word and a spirit from Him\"</h2></div><p lang=\"gd\" class=\"gd \">Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Ma'mar said that Qatadah said that the Ayah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَلِمَتُهُ أَلْقَاهَا إِلَىٰ مَرْيَمَ وَرُوحٌ مِّنْهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And His Word, which He bestowed on Maryam and a spirit from <span class=\"gray\">[created by]</span> Him;)</span> means, He said,</p><p class=\"qpc-hafs\">كُن</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Be)</span> and he was. </p><p lang=\"ig\" class=\"ig \">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ahmad bin Sinan Al-Wasiti said that he heard Shadh bin Yahya saying about Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَكَلِمَتُهُ أَلْقَاهَا إِلَىٰ مَرْيَمَ وَرُوحٌ مِّنْهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and His Word, which He bestowed on Maryam and a spirit from <span class=\"gray\">[created by]</span> Him;)</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">\"Isa was not the word. Rather, 'Isa came to existence because of the word.\" Al-Bukhari recorded that 'Ubadah bin As-Samit said that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مَنْ شَهِدَ أَنْ لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَأَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ، وَأَنَّ عِيسَى عَبْدُ اللهِ وَرَسُولُهُ وَكَلِمَتُهُ أَلْقَاهَا إِلى مَرْيَمَ وَرُوحٌ مِنْهُ، وَأَنَّ الْجَنَّةَ حَقٌّ، وَالنَّارَ حَقٌّ، أَدْخَلَهُ اللهُ الْجَنَّةَ عَلَى مَا كَانَ مِنَ الْعَمَلِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(If anyone testifies that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah Alone Who has no partners, and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and that 'Isa is Allah's servant and Messenger and His Word which He bestowed on Maryam and a spirit created by Him, and that Paradise is true and Hell is true, then Allah will admit him into Paradise with the deeds which he performed.)</span> In another narration, the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">مِنْ أَبْوَابِ الْجَنَّةِ الثَّمَانِيَّةِ يَدْخُلُ مِنْ أَيِّهَا شَاءَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(...through any of the eight doors of Paradise he wishes.)</span> Muslim also recorded it. Therefore, 'Ruh from Allah', in the Ayah and the Hadith is similar to Allah's statement,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَسَخَّرَ لَكُم مَّا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا مِّنْهُ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; it is all from Him.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[45:13]</span> meaning, from His creation. 'from Him' does not mean that it is a part of Him, as the Christians claim, may Allah's continued curses be upon them. Saying that something is from Allah, such as the spirit of Allah, the she-camel of Allah or the House of Allah, is meant to honor such items. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">هَٰذِهِ نَاقَةُ اللَّهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(This is the she-camel of Allah...)</span> and,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَطَهِّرْ بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[22:26]</span> An authentic Hadith states,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">فَأَدْخُلُ عَلَى رَبِّي فِي دَارِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(I will enter on my Lord in His Home)</span> All these examples are meant to honor such items when they are attributed to Allah in this manner. Allah said,</p><p class=\"ps qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ps\">فَآمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(so believe in Allah and His Messengers.)</span> believe that Allah is One and Alone and that He does not have a son or wife. Know and be certain that 'Isa is the servant and Messenger of Allah. Allah said after that,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلَا تَقُولُوا ثَلَاثَةٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Say not: \"Three!\")</span> do not elevate 'Isa and his mother to be gods with Allah. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him. In Surat Al-Ma'idah <span class=\"gray\">(chapter 5)</span>, Allah said,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ ثَالِثُ ثَلَاثَةٍ ۘ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ إِلَّا إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely, disbelievers are those who said: \"Allah is the third of the three.\" But there is none who has the right to be worshipped but One God.)</span> Allah said by the end of the same Surah,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَإِذْ قَالَ اللَّهُ يَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ أَأَنتَ قُلْتَ لِلنَّاسِ اتَّخِذُونِي </p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And <span class=\"gray\">(remember)</span> when Allah will say <span class=\"gray\">(on the Day of Resurrection)</span>: \"O 'Isa, son of Maryam! Did you say unto men: 'Worship me'?\")</span><span class=\"gray\">[5:116]</span> and in its beginning,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">لَّقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Surely, in disbelief are they who say that Allah is the Messiah, son of Maryam.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[5:17]</span></p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">The Christians, may Allah curse them, have no limit to their disbelief because of their ignorance, so their deviant statements and their misguidance grows. Some of them believe that 'Isa is Allah, some believe that he is one in a trinity and some believe that he is the son of Allah. Their beliefs and creeds are numerous and contradict each other, prompting some people to say that if ten Christians meet, they would end up with eleven sects!</p><div lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><h2>The Christian Sects</h2></div><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \">Sa'id bin Batriq, the Patriarch of Alexandria and a famous Christian scholar, mentioned in the year four hundred after the Hijrah, that a Christian Council convened during the reign of Constantine, who built the city that bears his name. In this Council, the Christians came up with what they called the Great Trust, which in reality is the Great Treachery. There were more than two thousand patriarchs in this Council, and they were in such disarray that they divided into many sects, where some sects had twenty, fifty or a hundred members, etc.! When the king saw that there were more than three hundred Patriarchs who had the same idea, he agreed with them and adopted their creed. Constantine who was a deviant philosopher – gave his support to this sect for which, as an honor, churches were built and doctrines were taught to young children, who were baptized on this creed, and books were written about it. Meanwhile, the king oppressed all other sects. Another Council produced the sect known as the Jacobites, while the Nestorians were formed in a third Council. These three sects agreed that 'Isa was divine, but disputed regarding the manner in which 'Isa's divinity was related to his humanity; were they in unity or did Allah incarnate in 'Isa! All three of these sects accuse each other of heresy and, we believe that all three of them are disbelievers. Allah said,</p><p class=\"sd qpc-hafs\" lang=\"sd\">انتَهُوا خَيْرًا لَّكُمْ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(Cease! <span class=\"gray\">(it is)</span> better for you.)</span> meaning, it will be better for you,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">إِنَّمَا اللَّهُ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ سُبْحَانَهُ أَن يَكُونَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(For Allah is <span class=\"gray\">(the only)</span> One God, hallowed be He above having a son.)</span> and He is holier than such claim,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ وَكِيلًا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs,)</span> for all are creatures, property and servants under His control and disposal, and He is the Disposer of the affairs. Therefore, how can He have a wife or a son among them,</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">بَدِيعُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَنَّىٰ يَكُونُ لَهُ وَلَدٌ</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(He is the originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have children.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[6:101]</span> and</p><p class=\"ar qpc-hafs\" lang=\"ar\">وَقَالُوا اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَلَدًا - لَّقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْئًا إِدًّا</p><p lang=\"en\" class=\"en \"><span class=\"gray\">(And they say: \"The Most Gracious <span class=\"gray\">(Allah)</span> has begotten a son. Indeed you have brought forth <span class=\"gray\">(said)</span> a terrible evil thing.\")</span> Up to His saying,</p><p class=\"fa qpc-hafs\" lang=\"fa\">فَرْدًا</p><p><span class=\"gray\">(Alone.)</span><span class=\"gray\">[19:95]</span></p>"
